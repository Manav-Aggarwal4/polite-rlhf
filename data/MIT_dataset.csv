1,ok uhm so have you looked at my resume or should I alright so I guess ah I am course 6-7 here at M,0,0.19261288316730724
2,T ah which is computational biology so its a mix of computers science and biology and actually thats where my interest lie in applying like algorithmic kinda software engineering too datasets dealing with genomics and biology,0,0.11161482957460721
3,Uhm some of that activities that you do out side of school include Camp Kesem which is a summer camp that we run for completely free for kids whose parents have cancer as well as ah amphibious achievement which is ah a high school tutoring program for inner city kids in Boston,0,0.3562570264627702
4,So ah my interest kinda laid both in a little bit of the health care I imagined I was going be a Doctor growing up and then it came down to the tee and Im like well I can do engineering and still apply and do the same things and help a lot more people,0,0.1768600974688769
5,Ok uhm one of the things we have to do for Camp Kesem is orgin or fundraise all the money to ah to run the camp which is over $50 000,0,0.33141366362000685
6,00,0,0.2387154408523499
7,Ah so one of the things that I individually spearhead every year is called the Camp Kesem I say you did auction where actually my fraternity and I go out and solicit uhm donations in the form of gift cards ah to raise money for a date auction where we actually sell dates and then we use this money obviously we donate it to Camp Kesem,0,0.38569783328078444
8,I spearhead the entire event and I kinda orginize everyone into committees and groups and I send the people out and make sure everything goes according to plan,0,0.4730831849790573
9,Ahh I guess the easiest team project I just I just had was last semester uhm I worked on this six double o five project which is algorithm or software architecture,1,0.7642480901805394
10,and we were put in a group of 3 people and it was standard you know we signed the contract everyone is supposed to work equally but it ended up being by the end of it that someone didn't like put there fair share of work in,0,0.13183543477660367
11,Ah essentially we talked to him we didn't really get it out we actually had to go to some of the T,0,0.1773623877837992
12,A's we got a little bit ah and that kinda like pushed him forward so I mean I guess what I am showing is like Im not affraid to go to the right method or like authority like where in cases this situation presents itself,0,0.3731609464718653
13,Uhmmm,0,0.2387154408523499
14,I would say for this job ah Im a little technically underprepared,0,0.4730831849790573
15,Ah I've yet I have only taken the introductory software classes so far and as well as introductory bio classes but I think just from sheer interest and sheer effort i will be able to kinda overcome these obstacles,0,0.27356360199342006
16,Ah Im very interested in the subject of computation biology and I think that I will be able to contribute a lot to this field uhm I've had a good amount of experience and I think I will be a solid intern,0,0.27356360199342006
17,Great how about you?,1,0.8452898993011722
18,I'm a little [???] by the resurgence of the hurricane but,0,0.3938730607112474
19,Yeah we were half way here and it just turned on a switch lightening winds and everything,0,0.33141366362000685
20,So yeah,0,0.07018898356424853
21,Okay um I'm a Junior here at MIT um I'm studying aerospace engineering um my my interests are generally in food mechanics control um design um mostly aircraft but protozoan [???] problems in general,0,0.32230062042973917
22,Um I like to um I like to play music listen to music um I run do some other team sports I like to play hockey,0,0.4716025486650735
23,Um okay so uh one of the projects that I've worked on since coming to MIT um was during my Freshman year I worked in the in the uh Artificial Intelligence group in uh Cesil [sp] which is a lab a computer science lab here at MIT,0,0.4716025486650735
24,And um I was working on a project with another student actually another Freshman uh basically we were tasked with the sort of bringing this project starting this project bring it up to the level where it could be presented at conference,0,0.05293056977477877
25,Um together and we were kind of left to work out the cooperation on our own and um there was um as the conference got closer about halfway um about halfway through the year Freshman year ah there were a bunch of issues that we had with um with um basically meeting the expectations that had been set before us in terms of what we were going to present,0,0.2977831921157918
26,Um and finishing in a timely basis,0,0.39245568688584626
27,And it came down to whether we were really going to be able to and there were other basically parts other people's work in the same group where work depended on us finishing in time so it really um really we had to make a decision weather we were just going to basically get done what we could but to the quality standard that the standard of quality that was expected of us or to um try to finish everything and to have other people's work potentially suffer because of our [??] hadn't really been up to snuff,0,0.033447486732009805
28,And um and so we kind of had a little bit of a disagreement about this but what ended up happening was um I went and talked to the professor and um sort of decided to um make them aware of what was happening because they weren't really aware that we had fallen behind,0,0.02268282555041385
29,And um sort of got the other student on board who had disagreed with me uh to do this uh and to let everyone else know what was going on and uh we ended up presenting a lot less than what was originally expected but um I think it was very much for the better,0,0.19821442239249298
30,Okay um so another another thing that I spend a lot of my time doing is called is an organization called Design Build Fly here um it's it's a design competition um run by the IAA which is an aerospace professional organization,0,0.3022838906250506
31,And um and uh you can enter a team from any university or group basically anywhere in the world,0,0.08967900877249617
32,It's mostly US university though,0,0.3887681302185169
33,And um these university teams basically build a plane um design it build it fly it as the competition name suggests and you compete them all at the end of the year compete against the other universities at the end of the year at one competition,0,0.14724051066147714
34,Basically um last year we had uh a design challenge it was pretty unique um and um so I'll take that as our challenge um so we basically had a year to solve this um and I was head of one of the sub-groups last year the actual design sub-group and um I mean we approached in a methodical way just like I think that's the best way to solve most problems,0,0.19821442239249298
35,Um got input from every team member um and um basically um looked at looked at all our possibilities um and um we ran the numbers,0,0.33141366362000685
36,Ultimately like I think that's the best way to solve most problems,0,0.3937983692193587
37,We ended up with um a design that got the best overall score,1,0.5052336361306978
38,on the basis of just basically incorporating um every team member's input,0,0.2387154408523499
39,Okay um so one of my I think definitely since coming here I've noticed that one of my biggest weaknesses is written communication,0,0.39521743774958146
40,Um I really was not intimidated by the thought of it in high school but I um definitely since coming here I find that perhaps um at the expense of technical skills my written communication skills have atrophied maybe is the right word,0,0.08546649212793798
41,And um so I definitely I think I'm um pretty aware of this and um and um,0,0.27356360199342006
42,I would definitely like to improve it and um,1,0.5724056014340263
43,so what I'm going to do is try to force myself whenever I'm writing papers or taking reports for whether it be for research or for classes just to go through the proper revision cycle force myself to make sure that I'm actually being um that I'm being succinct in what I'm saying have other people reading give me feedback,0,0.03148873152377071
44,Okay um I um I mean I think I don't know what this position that it is,0,0.4316075683376617
45,Yeah sure but if I knew that this position was I think that I would want it because um this is really what I thrive off of,0,0.11320191250810435
46,I um enjoy doing it um and I would be excited to come to work every day to do it,0,0.3080838209192851
47,Um which um that's like the biggest thing for me,0,0.39245568688584626
48,I um I would be excited to come do it and I know I would put my you know put my all into doing a good job at it because I would be excited to come do it,0,0.36752171347256557
49,And um I think that um I have a decent skill set to do this and I think that I'm qualified to contribute in this area,0,0.27356360199342006
50,Uhh I’m a junior at MIT uhh I’m double majoring in Management and Biology er I’m very interested in the world of finance uh business consulting all of those sorts of things,0,0.3022838906250506
51,Um so I’ve tried to take on different leadership roles that would prepare me for uh those sort of roles in the business world,0,0.3022838906250506
52,Outside of school I enjoy running cross-country and track I’m on the varsity team at MIT,0,0.4716025486650735
53,And umm I’m also very involved in Greek Life at MIT so I’m on the Panhellenic Executive Board as Vice President of Programming and also hold a leadership position in my sorority,0,0.04151446662050083
54,Umm so I think this past year my biggest priority has been my position as Vice President of Programming for Panhellenic and umm just in that position uhh I hold a leadership role on the exec board,0,0.2397396965153384
55,We have weekly meetings I’m charge of putting together our programming calendar for our entire year,0,0.4064865837293959
56,So I have interface with a lot of MIT faculty and bring together the exec board as a whole and the different sororities uhh to meet and attend different events,0,0.09444753853762607
57,And I think to put together all these events I’m working together with different people on campus I have to show leadership and show strong communication skills,0,0.27356360199342006
58,Umm so I guess this past semester actually I’m associate advisor for umm freshmen and I work with my freshmen advisor as well and another associate advisor and er the three of us were trying to come up with an event to host for the freshman and I think we all er were very uhh set on our ideas,0,0.1679107013538831
59,So having to full time communicate and work on an idea that could bring all our thoughts and goals together,0,0.19732153176187164
60,Um so we had to work together to formulate some sort of event that would satisfy each of our different goals and that was difficult at first ‘cause we had just met each other and it was difficult to understand where the other people were coming from,0,0.2977831921157918
61,But after that and after communicating what our main goals for the event for would be we eventually figured out what we wanted to do,0,0.1066093052570166
62,Uhh yeah so we had — we were trying to communicate via email at first so I think that was uhh inefficient especially since we had only met in a group once before umm so meeting in person and really trying to outline not just like what the event was going to be what our purpose of the event was going to be and what we trying to communicate with the freshmen,0,0.07732075106804231
63,I think by boiling down to what our purpose was for the event we were able to build it up from there,0,0.4278115946273691
64,Umm so I think one of my weaknesses is public speaking actually and uhh I think by taking a variety of classes especially this one class that I’m in that focuses on management and communication,0,0.1804648747309403
65,I’ve been kind of thrown into positions where I have to give impromptu speeches uhh and debate my point in different arguments and I think that the practice is helping me a lot and it allows me to become more comfortable and more confident in what I’m saying which I think helps me in the long run like public speaking in general,1,0.7642480901805394
66,I think I’ve been able to build up my confidence and know like how to structure my speeches and interviews and impromptus better,1,0.7642480901805394
67,Uhh I think my different leadership positions as well as my academic experience umm would allow me to perform well on the job,1,0.6100299707868481
68,I think I’ve worked umm both individually in a project as well as in a team-focused environment which umm I think is key for consulting and investment banking positions,1,0.7642480901805394
69,I also feel that my MIT background uh the quantitative analysis that I’ve done in classes as well as my internship experiences would help perform well on the job as well so…,1,0.7642480901805394
70,I'm good how are you?,1,0.6359670093958226
71,Ok so I'm a Junior at MIT majoring in Mechanical Engineering,0,0.3022838906250506
72,Uh my focus is in uh Robotics and Product Design,0,0.3022838906250506
73,Uh I'm originally from Seattle Washington,0,0.3022838906250506
74,Ummm I'm really interested in a combination of robotics and like psychology phased in,0,0.23226963873358347
75,So artificial intelligence or that vein of thinking,0,0.16634557565434505
76,Um I'm also I do a little bit of theater on the side,0,0.3022838906250506
77,So considering doing some sort of combination,0,0.07018898356424853
78,It's a wide range of interests so I'm trying to figure out a way to uh put in a lot of it into one thing but yeah,0,0.1768600974688769
79,Mmhmm,0,0.2387154408523499
80,Yeah ok,0,0.2387154408523499
81,So um in high school I was a life guard,0,0.09444753853762607
82,And that's it was a great job but it was a lot of working with other lifeguards in kind of in a a team situation,0,0.13457995866975905
83,Um and a lot of the times one person would have to step up in order to be a leader with you know uh like swi- like we taught swim lessons,1,0.5713018750224388
84,And I would have a partner with me and we'd both be teaching the same kids,0,0.14153925129016182
85,And I'd have to you know tell them what to do or tell them what exactly we were going to do during that class,0,0.17706877029180262
86,That sort of stuff,0,0.2387154408523499
87,Ok ummm not going to use the lifeguard example again,0,0.2387154408523499
88,Uhhhh in high school we would have to work on team projects a lot ummm I don't know in history class or that kind of a thing work working with projects,1,0.6790936156954253
89,And sometimes we'd have kids who wouldn't do their home- do you know their part on time or people who didn't like they what they were doing,0,0.29160838405168515
90,There was one specific time where we had a conflict where one girl just decided she didn't really want to do you know any of the any of the project she wasn't really showing up to class wasn't doing any of the any of the stuff she had to so we had to talk to her and figure out what was going on and kind of resolve the conflict in that way,0,0.08346230788665299
91,In what way? Like -,0,0.22382088283936255
92,Yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
93,So I mean us as a group we met with the teacher umm and told her what was happening,0,0.14153925129016182
94,And then,0,0.07018898356424853
95,The next the next day when the girl came to class we you know sat her down asked her why she wasn't doing the homework,0,0.3927973489599513
96,Whatever that kind of stuff,0,0.2387154408523499
97,But it was it was just a case of high school kids not wanting to do anything,0,0.07018898356424853
98,So (laughs),0,0.07018898356424853
99,Ok ummm I have a really bad habit of trying to do everything all at once and I sometimes put too much on my plate,0,0.07257576414901218
100,And I recognize that you have to delegate tasks in a group or tell someone when they've given you too much to do,0,0.11980571834570754
101,So I think it's kind of in terms of how I'm trying to improve that is be realistic with myself on the amount of time I have or what my skills are,0,0.27356360199342006
102,And if I need help ask for it or if I need someone to do part of it ask for it,0,0.09444753853762607
103,And early on not the day before something has to be done tell them that it's not going to happen,0,0.07018898356424853
104,Ummmm I think you should hire me because your company ummm is a great would be a great opportunity for me to learn and improve as an Engineer umm and I think I could just add a lot to the team in general in terms of like like my wide interests and and education background,1,0.6712110669180035
105,Good,1,0.9036480987850044
106,Ok umm I'm currently a junior at M,0,0.3022838906250506
107,studying electrical engineering and computer science,0,0.2387154408523499
108,Umm I first became interested in engineering in high school I guess when I worked in a lab at a material science lab at U,1,0.6100299707868481
109,Berkley,0,0.2387154408523499
110,Umm and since then I've worked at a variety of different places including labs and at uh and in the industry including electrical engineering labs here and at Standford and umm Promex Industries which is a chip packaging company in the silicon valley,0,0.4716025486650735
111,Umm in high school I was part of the school orchestra and I played bassoon,0,0.3022838906250506
112,I was the principle bassoon there,0,0.3938730607112474
113,So that means I was in charge of the bassoon section,0,0.09444753853762607
114,So basically umm I ran extra I ran practices for within our section outside of uh when the orchestra would get together and practice,0,0.14153925129016182
115,I coordinated that,0,0.3938730607112474
116,I also uh set up events between the woodwind sections to uh you know so people would get to know each other and you know we could practice together and things like that,1,0.7341612924740594
117,Umm this past summer I worked in Spain,0,0.4716025486650735
118,Umm in operations research and I was part of a research group there,0,0.3022838906250506
119,Umm it was so we had uh within our team it was communicating with each other was the biggest challenge because my Spanish isn't so great and their English wasn't so great,1,0.5852163666581659
120,So umm what we ended we basically communicated through like the papers through the papers we read umm we well one thing that helped was we both got like everyone they got better at speaking English I got better at understanding them,0,0.25353811833686407
121,I guess they got better at understanding my Spanish also,1,0.7642480901805394
122,So we were able to communicate by just you know talking really slowly repeating everything a couple times,0,0.02145176706406078
123,Umm we also did a lot of technical things and so those were mostly related to technical papers and things like that,1,0.5671518808090605
124,Those were written mostly in English so that was that wasn't so much of a problem for me,0,0.14316569343261962
125,but,0,0.07018898356424853
126,it made it because they were working in the area already and I was new to the area looking through these made it easier for me to understand what my role was what I was supposed to do,1,0.5338463461786015
127,Umm things like that,0,0.39245568688584626
128,umm well one thing right now is that I can get really hung up on small details and uh it becomes a problem because its it can be distracting and cause me to lose sight of like the big picture,0,0.11161482957460721
129,But since coming to M,0,0.07018898356424853
130,I've been I've been involved in a lot of classes a lot of activites and things and that's forced me to manage my time better,1,0.6490718829987913
131,So now that uh like I have because I have a lot of time constraints I'm forced to finish a project or assignment or whatever and I can't I can't get caught up in like little things that don't ultimately make a big a difference,0,0.1768600974688769
132,So um by being forced to manage my time more I'm uh overcoming this problem,0,0.04151446662050083
133,Well I have the I have the quantitative and qualitative skills necessary to accomplish uh accomplish project goals and get things done,0,0.4716025486650735
134,Uh I can solve problems and and can work pretty well in a team,0,0.2704138274778955
135,I'm also very interested in what this company does and um I'd really like to work there,0,0.38535842737456816
136,Good how are you?,1,0.8452898993011722
137,I'm a student at MIT and Im a junior right now but I'm probably gonna graduate this year,0,0.3635965128388753
138,So uh that's kind of exciting at scary at the same time,0,0.060661407047331486
139,Uh like I said I'm a computer science major so some of the stuff that I'm interested in is computational photography and a lot of graphic stuff,0,0.4716025486650735
140,I've got a bunch of experience with web development mainly uh front end development so that's uh I guess where a lot of my experience lies,0,0.39521743774958146
141,Um so I was a member of the Society of Women Engineers and with the Graduate Students Association of MIT and the senior class they run the fall career fair which is the only career fair in the fall and it's the biggest at MIT,0,0.08191717026182452
142,I was actually the publicity chair for that,0,0.18051115217519223
143,So it involves you know interfacing you know with over 230 companies and dealing with not only making the guide book and making sure all of the information is readily available to students but also publicizing individual info sessions and obviously the career fair itself,0,0.16870585012516354
144,SO um it definitely was a lot of responsibility and not only did I have to become a leader for the Society of Women Engineers but also fora leader for this smaller team of seven people that ran the career fair itself,0,0.1768600974688769
145,Well I,1,0.5724056014340263
146,so for one of my classes we have to it's a software design class where you have to work with other students,0,0.3071236897231417
147,So I was assigned two teammates randomly and we had one teammate who really wasn't pulling their weight and wasn't contributing in a way that was you know fair and even and so what we ended up doing is we all thankfully were able to sit down and talk,0,0.05873216278558005
148,We were able to get a hold of her and we realized it was because we were dividing the work in a way that made it really difficult for her it was not playing off her strengths,0,0.12568037976852317
149,So we redistributed the work and she was able to do things that were still helpful but played more to her strengths,0,0.19732153176187164
150,Um I think one of my weaknesses is I'm a perfectionist so when I do work on teams I have trouble sometimes delegating tasks because I want to micromanage and make sure everything is just the way it is,0,0.3937983692193587
151,But what I've done to overcome that is basically just sort of familiarized myself with how to um like say no to a task and just kind of I guess modualize [sic] projects more,0,0.14391429829796515
152,So I think I had trouble when I was always thinking big picture and then I would want to look at every single detail i that big picture,0,0.0705571610152508
153,But if I just give myself one part of the project and just you know divide it into different modules in my head then I'm able to just you know perfect my one part but not so much focus on every little detail,0,0.21899413203219753
154,Uh I think that my skill set is pretty unique because I'm both technical and also well-spoken and I'd be able to communicate really well,0,0.34651595146154224
155,And I think it's a unique combination to have both of those skills,0,0.15455013832531528
156,I'm doing fine uh thank you how about you? Um have you like you know um the storm I hope that hasn't like disturbed any power too much,1,0.9766711421137009
157,Oh yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
158,I mean Boston didn't get hit too bad so,0,0.21250816544335416
159,That's at least very fortunate,0,0.39245568688584626
160,Um okay so I'm a current junior at MIT,0,0.3022838906250506
161,I'm studying biological engineering,0,0.3938730607112474
162,Um so it's some some of the things I do on campus,0,0.3022838906250506
163,Um I'm really involved in um MIT Met Life,0,0.12805425526188313
164,So I'm I'm secretary of the club and I go to the meetings um and um part of my roles like help you know organize groups where um poster sessions and information sessions,0,0.21899413203219753
165,Just like spread the word of Met Life on campus um and that's um sort of helps me like explore like it has really gotten me more interested in a field of like healthcare,0,0.17963402645220658
166,Um that plus like my um my studies,0,0.4716025486650735
167,Um I'm also involved in Chinese student club escort culture,0,0.3022838906250506
168,So I do a lot of you know pudding on campus for um events like night market which I worked I helped organize just last week,0,0.21899413203219753
169,So um it that sort of helps me with communication my communication skills,0,0.09444753853762607
170,You know talking to the officers of other student clubs,0,0.13115931029929018
171,Okay so um last um uh this past summer I worked in a research lab in Bangkok and it was the first time that I had ever been outside of you know the United States for an extended period of time,1,0.5380555749984539
172,And one of my assignments was to you know sort of lead uh sort of like drive the direction of like a research project that they were doing which was to research um a generic um in hopes of releasing it to the market,0,0.21899413203219753
173,Um sometime in the future,0,0.2387154408523499
174,Because I had I was partnered up with some a lab partner that was less experienced than I was um I found myself in many situations having to help guide her along and getting up to speed with the project and the techniques that we needed to do our experiments,0,0.4064865837293959
175,Um it was it was a little bit of a strange dynamic because she was older than me,0,0.2115156921086478
176,Because she was an incoming graduate student but she did not have much research like lab experience,0,0.39245568688584626
177,So I had to balance like being informative without making it seem like this like she was in some ways my superior,0,0.1768600974688769
178,So that was like an um I had I had to like teach her the techniques you know coming off as like oh I know more than you do,0,0.21899413203219753
179,Um but what I found was what worked for both of us was that um I would like explain it to her before we were in the lab which helped cut down a lot of the frustration that came up if like she had to ask me questions like every like between like every set,0,0.3694476305055536
180,So that's um that's probably the one way I showed leadership,0,0.118032441819917
181,Okay so the a couple um IPs I worked for a start up um they were a green billing research directory,0,0.4716025486650735
182,online,0,0.2387154408523499
183,And I worked for my fellow exterior on helping to market this the use of this directory to the clients,0,0.1768600974688769
184,Um so we had to it was a little bit difficult because we had to like we had to cold call like people and getting over the initial awkwardness of what it's like to talk to somebody you've never met or seen before and trying to like pitch an idea to them and be like oh there's this really great resource and you've signed up for it,0,0.15796148039797941
185,But we've noticed that you like hadn't used it,0,0.2428917736095061
186,Um are there things that like you feel would make it better,1,0.5963737714021422
187,Um things that you would like to see that you think would make it more effective,1,0.5963737714021422
188,And um we both had to sort of like teach ourselves how to talk to like the the reps that we're calling and we would um strategize what worked what didn't what had people respond and what didn't and-,0,0.19732153176187164
189,And by like documenting it all down also,0,0.13457995866975905
190,So that we could leave like a record of what worked for maybe someone else was to found,0,0.23979299191356468
191,So um eventually we actually got like a system,0,0.07692020109018043
192,Like a way we would structure the questions and ask them that word and like list like a couple response,1,0.5052336361306978
193,Okay um so something so a weakness that I found um and I'm still like working to try to like overcome it is I tend to be long winded in explaining things,0,0.08191717026182452
194,Um it's hard for me to take something that I'm thinking about and communicating it um concisely um the first time around,0,0.2397396965153384
195,Because I feel like I always leave something out after I finish saying it,1,0.6100299707868481
196,So I tend to go back and elaborate,0,0.09444753853762607
197,And then while I'm thinking about it still I'll like talk more about what's coming to mind,0,0.27356360199342006
198,Um it's something that I've been working on by siding it for things like this,0,0.4716025486650735
199,And by trying to take up a more prominent role in like the in like the clubs I'm in and like trying to you know participate more actively in the classes,0,0.21899413203219753
200,Um trying to as much as I can to go to um lab presentations for my year off and speaking-,0,0.3022838906250506
201,In front of audiences to try to um make myself less long winded and more precise,0,0.4716025486650735
202,Um I think that I can bring I don't know like something different a new perspective to the table especially coming from MIT,1,0.6100299707868481
203,Um having had like a very quantitative background,0,0.39245568688584626
204,Um and given that I've had like extensive experience um in research um and my leadership activities on campus I think that I can bring both the technical skills and um a way to effectively hopefully communicate to um communicate my ideas and bring like a different sort of perspective to your company,1,0.6712110669180035
205,And I'm hardworking um and I always wanna make sure I will do a good job and detail oriented and um I just love working with other people on like projects that excite me,0,0.1768600974688769
206,So um that's something that I come from [inaudible] that flatters me is working with people elaborating,0,0.04151446662050083
207,And that's um definitely a skill that I can bring to your company so thank you for your time,1,0.9213289183094181
208,Very good how are you?,0,0.45741044182905144
209,Yea um so I am junior here at MIT ummm studying economics as well as urban planning and within those departments I am really trying to focus on international development,0,0.23226963873358347
210,Ummm and because I am interested in either after school going in to either like public health or umm public policy type areas,0,0.4716025486650735
211,But both focusing on international development,0,0.07018898356424853
212,Ummm yea that’s a little bit,0,0.2387154408523499
213,I'm from right outside of Philadelphia ummm and I am the uh second youngest of 3,1,0.6490718829987913
214,Uh sure ummm so currently I am actually the co president of an organization here on campus called club med (sp?),0,0.12805425526188313
215,And we actually started last year but last year it was founded by a different person ummm although I was part of the like founding board I guess you would say,0,0.2084526096831633
216,Ummm and I guess last year basically what happened was the person who founded it did it for her resume and she wasn't really invested in it,0,0.20470832345123025
217,Umm and so basically last year was pretty much a flop we did we didn't accomplish much last year,1,0.5052336361306978
218,So this year has been trying to start over ummm as well as trying to take what kind of we felt what was wrong last year and really try to fix those pieces,0,0.05718337446450901
219,Yea,0,0.2387154408523499
220,umm that is a good question umm I think so freshman year ummm I participated in a program here called terescope (sp?),1,0.6100299707868481
221,And it’s a program that basically gives freshman a problem to solve,0,0.030395260313939607
222,Ummm kind of like a world problem,0,0.2115156921086478
223,And so you are just kind of left on your own to solve it,0,0.08967900877249617
224,Umm and our problem was solving world hunger,0,0.17070910373751436
225,So it is really like a problem that no one has actually solved,0,0.02142171260519209
226,Ummm hmmm so let's think so that is a good question,1,0.5309974197500003
227,I think sometimes I have trouble working on a project when like for example when I have too much time right,1,0.5737824960575687
228,So umm for example this summer I was working in DC ummm and I felt like when I wasn't given an exact dead line I didn't necessarily like push myself to work to get it done because it wasn't -- I didn't have a dead line like I wasn’t sure when I needed it to get done so I was like oh that’ fine okay I can do it later,0,0.1352367738043197
229,So I think one of my weaknesses I think it is pushing things off unless there is a deadline,0,0.0705571610152508
230,So I really have been trying setting internal deadlines for myself,0,0.03414728906078335
231,And trying to stick to those deadlines and I think it is really hard I think it is really hard when you have a lot of things to do to figure out how to prioritize and actually come through with the deadlines,0,0.03249104510301348
232,And I think that is really important skill throughout life,0,0.11320191250810435
233,So for example this week I have a lot of things due at the end of the week,0,0.09444753853762607
234,So trying to get at least a certain amount done by Tuesday and kind of like evaluating my progress throughout the week is something I have been trying to work on more,0,0.1768600974688769
235,Well we will pretend this is the (inaudible) institute,0,0.2977831921157918
236,I am really interested in studying the intersection on nutrition and health ummm especially in the kind of evaluating project area,0,0.18051115217519223
237,So recently I actually switched to economics umm I was originally studying biology but I felt that I could - that there is more to be done in economics in terms of helping people and I really would be excited to learn more about how food security and nutrition intersect,0,0.20919740887807237
238,And I would be very committed and willing to work as much as you needed me to,0,0.21899413203219753
239,Doing well,0,0.39245568688584626
240,How are you?,0,0.15445987288440202
241,Um my name is Stephie,0,0.3022838906250506
242,Um I am a junior here at MIT,0,0.3022838906250506
243,Um and see I'm currently studying Computer Science so um,0,0.09444753853762607
244,I'm a six three um and I'm here hoping to you know get in touch and um see if there's any opportunity for me over at Google,0,0.22001190438092705
245,Um see,0,0.2387154408523499
246,Hm so last semester um I took a class in software constructions,0,0.3022838906250506
247,So it's six double-o five here,0,0.07018898356424853
248,And um throughout the semester we had you know many individual projects,0,0.13474691236493075
249,But also two group projects,0,0.07018898356424853
250,And um something I've noticed very much here at MIT is that people don't like to take initiative and so um you know my- we were doing out first group project and um you know my- my partners were pretty cool,0,0.478781078165742
251,But no one seemed to want to arrange a time to meet up and actually get work done,0,0.05007391579932511
252,So I jumped in and you know shot- shot out a few emails,0,0.11980571834570754
253,And made it work,0,0.13457995866975905
254,[laugh] How about that? Um let's talk about that second group project in this class,0,0.2387154408523499
255,Unfortunately my um my group members in this uh for this project were not quite as awesome as the one before,0,0.32230062042973917
256,Um and uh for some reason um there were two guys and uh they- they were overriding my code in the repository,0,0.3022838906250506
257,So um they've completely disregarded any work I've done even after I'd emailed them and told them hey you know there are tools to help resolve conflicts in code-,0,0.10429856273872934
258,-if we're both working on the same thing,0,0.33141366362000685
259,And so eventually I had to go to the TA and to the professor went spoke to Ann Hunter,0,0.09444753853762607
260,And they helped me resolve the situation,0,0.13457995866975905
261,So you know sometimes you try your best in the situation and you really-- some things are out of your control,0,0.2066034157898696
262,But um usually people you can go to,0,0.11222070821856067
263,Thanks,1,0.929060350894491
264,Um see,0,0.2387154408523499
265,I- let's see I- for the longest time even when I was small I've always been pretty quiet,0,0.4716025486650735
266,So um and back in elementary school even,0,0.07018898356424853
267,Uh on my progress reports they would- they would just say Stephie is- is this sweet girl [laughs] and then you know I'd get a mediocre grade for participation stuff like that,0,0.10429856273872934
268,And so that's been an on going struggle for me um throughout my life,0,0.04151446662050083
269,But um people really aren't as scary as as sometimes I think they- they seem to be so,0,0.02508721643408232
270,It's been going well,0,0.39245568688584626
271,Um see uh,0,0.2387154408523499
272,Well I've- I've taken classes with um with like speaking components and presentations,0,0.4716025486650735
273,Um so it's it's a way to get in- my feet into the water,0,0.3938730607112474
274,But um it's been a good experience so,0,0.13457995866975905
275,Hmm I think that I have a lot to offer,0,0.4316075683376617
276,Um my skill set is pretty good? Um you know I've- I've picked up a lot of skills here at MIT and also on my own um through research here at MIT,1,0.7070690685863894
277,And you know I think I can be a valuable asset to to,0,0.32951325534129816
278,Good,1,0.9036480987850044
279,How are you?,0,0.15445987288440202
280,Um so I'm a junior at MIT,0,0.3022838906250506
281,I'm majoring in environmental engineering,0,0.3938730607112474
282,Um and so I'm taking classes this semester in hydrology environmental transport,0,0.3022838906250506
283,Um I've done internships previously with environmental restoration companies,0,0.3022838906250506
284,And I also participated in research last summer,0,0.09444753853762607
285,Um I'd like to go to Grad school after I graduate in Environmental Enginneering again,0,0.4716025486650735
286,Um so this semester I became President of the Women's Independent Living Group,0,0.3022838906250506
287,Um after being House Manager last semester,0,0.2387154408523499
288,So I've worked through a lot of problems within the house in trying to kind of get the right atmosphere in the house,0,0.08191717026182452
289,Um So as house manager um I organized work week at the beginning of this year,0,0.4716025486650735
290,So it's a time when - there's about 30 members in the house and everybody gets together and um works on the house paints rooms like fixes it up before the school year starts,0,0.13457995866975905
291,So I organized that assigned jobs to people and facilitated that,0,0.09444753853762607
292,Um so I'm also on the rowing team,0,0.3022838906250506
293,And I'm not sure if this is exactly what you're looking for but I guess I was in the second boat last year and we were having a lot of problems throughout the season kind of like we would go to a race and we would be okay but we weren't performing up to our standards,0,0.2439282069851289
294,And so it was a big struggle for me to try and figure out how to kind of help turn the attitude around in the boat,0,0.038668391942406406
295,Um and we were finally able to pull it off in our very last race and we won the semi-finals at Patriot League,1,0.5052336361306978
296,So I think it's the right mix of like knowing when to speak up say something and knowing what to say,0,0.27356360199342006
297,Um kind of by speaking up and letting people know not like putting people down but letting people know that there was way more potential to be had,0,0.39245568688584626
298,Um one of my weaknesses I tend to be I guess a little more withdrawn sometimes,0,0.2397396965153384
299,Um and that's something I've been working on like I've taken leadership in my house and as the rowing team um but I think something good about that is I tend to be a very good listener,0,0.27356360199342006
300,Um I think I'm like extremely responsible,1,0.6100299707868481
301,Um I have a lot of experience,0,0.3022838906250506
302,And this is something that I think will help further my career goals and something I'm really excited about learning about,0,0.11320191250810435
303,And so I'll put a lot of effort into this project,0,0.09444753853762607
304,Um pretty good,0,0.39245568688584626
305,Um yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
306,So um my name is Dina Wong,0,0.09444753853762607
307,I'm a student at MIT,0,0.3938730607112474
308,I'm in my third year,0,0.4730831849790573
309,I'm majoring in course six seven which is biological engin-um biologic-um Computational Biology,0,0.3938730607112474
310,Um It's pretty new so it only like existed my freshman year,0,0.4716025486650735
311,So yeah so I've been taking a lot of computer science and technology classes,0,0.09444753853762607
312,Um in my free time I like to um write for the Tech and a be edit um articles at the um the student newspaper for the student newspaper,0,0.4716025486650735
313,Um I also like to bake and like um like exercising and running stuff like that,0,0.4716025486650735
314,So currently I'm looking for an internship for the summer,0,0.09444753853762607
315,Um I actually um I'm exploring like the industry side of um like computer science ummm and I think that if I find a position or if I find like the industry side like really suits me that I would want to go for like um being hired by a company after I graduate,0,0.11320191250810435
316,Ok,0,0.2387154408523499
317,Soo this I guess this happens quite a bit during a my stint as um campus life editor of the Tech,0,0.4316075683376617
318,So a what happens is um like um for my section I have to a make sure that the publication is like going out on time,0,0.1768600974688769
319,So um one time I demonstrated leadership was in getting a um column for for the campus life section,0,0.09444753853762607
320,So there was a um the precedent of the Pan-Hellenic society um want to have like a column in the Tech for Greek life,0,0.060661407047331486
321,And so um I negotiated with her to like um sort to arrange how the column would work because like um I guess we both had the same like um intent of how we should like publish articles but her ideas were slightly different from mine in that she if your original idea was that she wanted to I could it was kind of like advertisement in the Tech and um people like like the Tech is a newspaper you don’t like necessarily want articles to be like advertising sororities so we made a deal with her to like um write articles that would be more about the personal side and not like um to avertisey,0,0.43722042557844615
322,Hmm Ah,0,0.2387154408523499
323,Um I guess again probably using um let me see,0,0.4316075683376617
324,ok so I guess again on for the Tech cause it's like my major leadership my pretty main extracurricular,1,0.6100299707868481
325,Um I guess um what happened was um shit um I really don’t know how to answer these type of questions sorry,1,0.531679296916699
326,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
327,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
328,Ok I guess I'll go back to high school then,0,0.4316075683376617
329,So in high school I was on the cross country team and um so what happened was we a like we're we're competing right so we um so we had to like um train in groups so on so on team sports and what happened was kind of that the um so there's a girls team and a boys team and like um the boys team a was i guess people the boys were like motivated and things like that and like they would um and the girls team was like less motivated and wha and so since they were less motivated they would do stuff like if the coach asked you to like run around this block than they would like sort of cut take short cuts and stuff like that,0,0.43722042557844615
330,Um I guess what happened was my um there was another student on the team who was also who was also like really motivated and I wanted to improve running so I think initially I guess we sort of tried asking people like Hey um could you not do that? but eventually what happened was I guess we me and the other more motivated girl trained with the boys team because that was really the only way like I mean there's there's motivating people but in the sense like they have to want to do it themselves so I guess that's what happened,1,0.5573395298278505
331,OK Um I would let me think,0,0.4316075683376617
332,One of my I guess one weakness I have is um well MIT is full of smart people right,1,0.5737824960575687
333,Um if everybody is like always doing like these amazing products and projects and I mean like coding since they were like nine years old and stuff so because of the like abundance of geniuses I sometimes I feel like I'm not as at their level,1,0.7642480901805394
334,So um I guess what I try what I try to do is like I I was feeling badly but then I realized,0,0.1352367738043197
335,Well first of all I guess everybody has to start somewhere,1,0.6100299707868481
336,I've been like training my own skills like reach up to the to learn more in depth and eventually I'll get that good just takes like practice and I've also been like just sort of telling myself that it's to like just apply to things and like don’t and I guess sort of fake it till you make it right,0,0.2972296817653244
337,So make like um project the image of like confidence and then it will probably come,0,0.16634557565434505
338,Well um so I've been learning a lot about um computer science since I was here,0,0.4716025486650735
339,I've um I am a pretty reliable person so like for example during the Tech I always like am reliably like editing everything getting thing in time on deadline,1,0.6490718829987913
340,Though if you gave me an assignment then I would reliably like a work on it and um and I and not procrastinate or anything like that,0,0.3260083851308101
341,Um I'm pretty good at learning as demonstrated by my ability to succeed at MIT and um I also um I would a really enjoy working and contributing to the Google community as a person and a I hope that a I would be able to produce um good products,0,0.06788794010145202
342,I'm good,1,0.5724056014340263
343,How are you?,0,0.15445987288440202
344,OK,0,0.2387154408523499
345,Um I'm a junior in aerospace engineering um I'm originally from Kansas City um and I was born on the East Coast,0,0.09444753853762607
346,I'm currently deciding whether or not I want to go into aerospace industry or go into consulting or another aviation-related field,0,0.4730831849790573
347,I'm minoring in management,0,0.3938730607112474
348,Uh so right now I'm actually quite involved with the Global Poverty Initiative here at MIT and I'm currently the director of ACTION under GPI Global Poverty Initiative so I'm currently in charge of the projects we are involved with abroad so that includes projects in Mexico service projects in Central Mexico,0,0.057803487703000624
349,as well as a project with a domestic,0,0.39245568688584626
350,an NGO in India that works with domestic workers in setting up domestic workers with local employers and training women and working with employer-employee relationships,0,0.39245568688584626
351,Um most of my work has been on the Mexico project and I led a team -- I actually have traveled down three times -- and we have a greenhouse initiative that is our main goal right now and I oversaw a team of four people on two separate trips where we built fourteen greenhouses as well as conducted classes at the secondary school as well as classes for adults in both computers and English,0,0.4977678613554029
352,that was really validating,0,0.09607975816263775
353,Um well most of the challenges that I've faced with a team have been with my projects in Mexico,0,0.4716025486650735
354,Um so probably the largest challenge that we had when we got there was working across cultures and identifying with community members because when we went there we had originally thought -- we had brainstormed project ideas like solar ovens and greenhouses and bio-digesters which are used to make fertilizer from natural waste -- and when we got there we talked to lots of community members,0,0.42635799881413966
355,First of all they can be rather skeptical of outsides coming in so we first had to earn their trust and we had to establish that we weren't going to um just come in and give them something and leave,0,0.3523851046866215
356,This wasn't going to be a hand-out,0,0.2387154408523499
357,Yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
358,Sometimes I can be disorganized,0,0.18755857915192653
359,I mean I think everyone struggles with that a little bit but the way I try to deal with that,0,0.13593303533129147
360,recently I've taken to becoming a list person,0,0.3022838906250506
361,[laughs] In order for me to ensure that I get things done -- I always get things done but you know when you leave things for the last minute sometimes the quality of your work is not always the best,1,0.5991253810632329
362,I think I have a diverse skill set and I have very diverse background working with other cultures not only in Mexico but I've had experiences in Europe and in China,1,0.7642480901805394
363,I'm bi-racial myself and I think I have a very unique background and especially as an engineer who's interested in going into consulting and I have work experience at Space-X and NASA and um other companies,0,0.43832997198318147
364,I'm doing very well,1,0.5724056014340263
365,How are you?,0,0.15445987288440202
366,I'm currently a junior at MIT,0,0.3938730607112474
367,I'm studying biology,0,0.3938730607112474
368,Ummm I am interested in pursuing some sort of a future in medicine but I don't know if necessarily like the medschool route or more the research side but you know having to do with patient care and drugs and things like that,0,0.21899413203219753
369,So within the broader field but I'm not sure specifically what path yet,0,0.09444753853762607
370,Umm okay,0,0.2387154408523499
371,So umm the summer after my sophomore year of high school I actually went on a leadership trip,0,0.03414728906078335
372,Um so it was through uh my summer camp and some other camps are a part of the same foundation and we actually went on a trip to Israel for the summer,0,0.18841588439324772
373,And it was the first time I'd ever been which was very exciting um,0,0.1768600974688769
374,And it was a very cool experience 'cause not only were they teaching a lot of leadership skills but also a lot of you know the daily activities we did like going for really long hikes and things just kind of brought out that innate like 'someone has to make sure everyone brought enough water,0,0.09808217960583292
375,And you know make sure the group's staying together and things like that um,0,0.16870585012516354
376,So that was definitely something that I think impacted me a lot,0,0.15455013832531528
377,And I think you know in other leadership roles you know even in a small group project or something,0,0.19261288316730724
378,A lot of the time I find myself reflecting back to that trip and kind of saying 'Okay we were in a tough spot like that before,1,0.5852163666581659
379,'How did we kinda rally the group back together?',0,0.1811858356720038
380,Something like that,0,0.39245568688584626
381,Umm sure,0,0.2387154408523499
382,So a time when I was working on a team,0,0.09444753853762607
383,So I think um this situation arises a lot of times in lab,0,0.15455013832531528
384,So I was um this past summer I was back in Israel and working in a lab at the Hebrew University,0,0.09444753853762607
385,Um and it was a pretty small lab,0,0.39245568688584626
386,I was working um for one of the post-ocs and then there are about four other people in the lab,0,0.3938730607112474
387,And so things like that kind of came up all the time where it would be a matter of 'Okay we don't have the exact materials that we needed to do the experiment,0,0.19732153176187164
388,Can I borrow this from this lab?',0,0.3022838906250506
389,'Can someone check down the hall if maybe they have this?',0,0.2869118389241647
390,And just kind of that group mentality of making sure everyone was getting their experiments done,0,0.07018898356424853
391,Um and then it was also interesting 'cause there were a lot of language barriers that were going on in lab,0,0.39245568688584626
392,Um 'cause there were some Israelis that were working there,0,0.2387154408523499
393,And then one of the PhD students was from Russia and then two of the post-ocs were from India,0,0.07018898356424853
394,Um and so the common language among them was English but in sort of a broken-down manner in different ways,0,0.11521478613197428
395,So that was kind of interesting also coming in and sort of having to step into that role of almost like translating English to English for people,0,0.16634557565434505
396,And checking emails and making sure they made sense and things like that,0,0.13457995866975905
397,Sure,0,0.2387154408523499
398,Uh I think sometimes I tend to be a little bit on the shy side,0,0.4316075683376617
399,Especially um like if I'm the person coming into a new group or a new experience,0,0.4716025486650735
400,And I think I just kind of have to remind myself like there's a reason why I'm here,0,0.27356360199342006
401,And I can add something to the experience even if it's not in a major sort of leadership necessarily role,0,0.09444753853762607
402,Like for example the lab last summer I was the only undergraduate working there,0,0.4716025486650735
403,And so that kind of brought out that shyer side,0,0.07018898356424853
404,'Cause I walked in and you know everyone had already been working there and they were all much older and much more established in their fields,0,0.3611869277514505
405,Um so just kind of keep keeping up the reminders that like 'I'm here to get something out of this experience and hopefully I can help out the lab while at the same time realizing that you know I'm not necessarily going to come up with a big breakthrough today,1,0.5380555749984539
406,And that's okay,0,0.07018898356424853
407,'And you know I still need to feel comfortable here; I need to add what I can and then the rest will fall into place when it does,0,0.3829632284737189
408,' And I think just you know keeping those reminders coming that I don't have to be like the person solving the problem right away has kind of helped me to take a step back relax; see what I what I can add to the table without freaking out that it's not enough,0,0.4588075285625812
409,Um I think for me where I'm where I am at this point where I'm deciding between sort of going the medical school route or the research route;,0,0.4316075683376617
410,The more time I spend in a hospital setting I think definitely will enable me to kind of make those distinctions between if it's the one-on-one patient care that I care more about or if it's the sort of overarching like how are these people being cured more from a scientific standpoint?,1,0.6100299707868481
411,Um and I think just sort of that open-mindedness towards both sides will help out the hospital a lot,0,0.4316075683376617
412,Because you know it's always good to have people that are interacting between the pure doctors and the pure scientist level,0,0.45741044182905144
413,And someone that has interest in both areas and can kind of mediate and interact between those two,0,0.07018898356424853
414,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
415,I'm good,1,0.5724056014340263
416,How are you?,0,0.15445987288440202
417,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
418,I'm a core 16 here at MIT which is aeronautical and astronautical engineering,0,0.3938730607112474
419,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
420,I'm a junior,0,0.3938730607112474
421,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
422,And my experience has been last summer I worked with NASA Glenn Research Center doing ah interplanetary rover work,0,0.1768600974688769
423,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
424,I was,0,0.3938730607112474
425,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
426,So that it could be recovered by um the people who are using it,0,0.07018898356424853
427,Um and I personally worked on the steerable para-foil parachute for that,0,0.4716025486650735
428,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
429,Yes,0,0.2387154408523499
430,I can,0,0.3938730607112474
431,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
432,When we were working on the Dropsonde project which I mentioned before um there was um some question about whether we were gonna be able to get a good drop site for it,1,0.5852163666581659
433,Um because in order to test how the navigation system worked we had to have the thing flying for a significant period of time,1,0.5052336361306978
434,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
435,So it was fairly,0,0.16634557565434505
436,it takes um not very long for most things to fall from reasonable height,0,0.2115156921086478
437,So we had to find a really good drop location,0,0.07692020109018043
438,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
439,And we were having a lot of trouble with that,0,0.04721556736134647
440,And um we,0,0.1066093052570166
441,we were pursuing some options with working with NASA um but it didn't look like they were gonna work out,0,0.19732153176187164
442,And I took the initiative um and I went and I contact the owner of this airport where we had been skydiving there previously there in the summer,0,0.14153925129016182
443,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
444,Well I guess I should probably pick a different time that I was working on a team,1,0.6100299707868481
445,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
446,So um when,0,0.07018898356424853
447,for the Venus rover which was the other project that I worked on last summer,0,0.4716025486650735
448,Um we had um we basically started just with with nothing,0,0.33141366362000685
449,Um because um this this idea's really like in early design phases,0,0.17963402645220658
450,It's not like,0,0.39245568688584626
451,there's no Venus rover being built by any team,0,0.2387154408523499
452,It's just people like sitting down working equations figuring out what would be feasible for a Venus rover,0,0.39245568688584626
453,The turbine did,0,0.2387154408523499
454,Which I was happy about,0,0.4716025486650735
455,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
456,Yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
457,I am not extremely well organized,1,0.5724056014340263
458,Um so ahh yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
459,My,0,0.3938730607112474
460,my work tends to be a little bit of a mess and I have trouble meeting deadlines,0,0.43441758665660263
461,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
462,But I,0,0.09444753853762607
463,um overcome it just by recognizing something that,0,0.2387154408523499
464,recognizing that something that will happen to be where my work will become sloppy and I will miss deadlines if I don't really pay attention to it,0,0.11161482957460721
465,Um so I do writing down deadlines keeping a Google calendar,0,0.3022838906250506
466,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
467,Trying to keep myself on top of things,0,0.4716025486650735
468,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
469,I think you should hire me because um I am intelligent and hard working,1,0.6372689311704398
470,Um and I think,0,0.4316075683376617
471,I think my grades at MIT really prove that I am intelligent and hard working,0,0.3133450648821134
472,Um and I think that as well as that I also have the experience that you would want at JPO,1,0.6712110669180035
473,Working on interplanetary rovers I've done that before,0,0.3022838906250506
474,Also worked on teams um to try to accomplish goals,0,0.39245568688584626
475,Um so I think that really I am a pretty well qualified applicant for this position,0,0.34651595146154224
476,I'm doing well thank you,1,0.9864801121167501
477,Um I'm currently a junior studying chemistry in biology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology,0,0.3022838906250506
478,I'm primarily interested in biochemistry research pacifically how small molecules interact with the body um and produce physiological effects,0,0.3938730607112474
479,I've done research as an undergraduate um in the lab that's chemistry and biological um engineering,0,0.3938730607112474
480,So I've been able to work at a chemical biology interface,0,0.1768600974688769
481,I've demonstrated leadership through my role in dorm's house government,0,0.4730831849790573
482,I've been dieting chair and environmental chair for almost two years,0,0.45468571979582034
483,Um so through that I've been able to work with others and um work with the like other members of house government as well as the administration,0,0.4716025486650735
484,Um and bring um concerns from residents to the administration and represent them,0,0.11521478613197428
485,I've um been able to work on teams um during my undergraduate classes we um in our laboratory classes in the chemistry department we generally work um in small groups of two or three,1,0.7895481244380342
486,So there's definitely been challenges in those situations where for example team member accidentally does something wrong like cost us a lot of product or makes our experiment go wrong and I found it helpful to kind of be like able to put you know aside my annoying side when someone's done in the moment and figure how to move forward,0,0.1554588016020326
487,Um as opposed to just being frustrated with the fact where we are currently try to see how to go forward with that,0,0.17070910373751436
488,I would say my weakness is actually leadership experience because I haven't had a lot of it,0,0.11220525447622531
489,Um I also haven't had much experience working in a team environment but I have been seeking out opportunities to improve this um looking for even more of a role in house government this year um and actually running for house president,0,0.23226963873358347
490,How soon to try to get a leadership position,0,0.12279001203990068
491,So I'm trying to more experience in those areas,0,0.09444753853762607
492,I think you should hire me because I bring experience from um from my education at M,1,0.6725207706449717
493,which has really prepared me for a rigorous work environment to work hard and be able to solve problems and I've demonstrated this to my work at other internships and my research that I've already done,0,0.11161482957460721
494,Good thanks,1,0.9974535670984142
495,Um I'm a junior at MIT,0,0.3022838906250506
496,Um I'm majoring in biological engineering,0,0.3022838906250506
497,I play for the women's varsity volleyball team at MIT,0,0.3938730607112474
498,Um and also then also fairly involved with my sorority at MIT alpha phi,1,0.5338463461786015
499,I'm the vice president of the chapter of operations so I'm pretty involved with the house maintenance and things like that,0,0.43441758665660263
500,Um I think my most active role in leadership would be within my sorority um it's my job to make sure that everything is operating smoothly so thats includes coordinating with our chef like meals that are working that all our facilities including our washers and driers and everything are up and running,1,0.7120528119563496
501,We've had like issues with refrigerators,0,0.2977831921157918
502,Um like last year when the power went off there was a lot of issues with that that we had to kind of adjust so I think I being being able to maintain calm and like make sure everything was dealt with a timely and efficient manner,0,0.19821442239249298
503,Um so the obvious team choice would be my volleyball team,0,0.3022838906250506
504,Um and we actually get along pretty well so there's not too many conflicts,0,0.12568037976852317
505,But I think this is silly as it sounds,0,0.0705571610152508
506,One of the things is what we eat after meals or after games,0,0.33141366362000685
507,Um and so I think it's kind of nice sometimes I'll just speak with one or two players r come to a consensus before we really discuss with the team what we are doing after games,0,0.4560009826490152
508,And so that way I kind of get a feel like amongst the 3 or 4 of us like what the team would like be most receptive to something like that and so then we come to some kind of consensus this is what we're gonna do instead of opening it up to the entire team,0,0.30353397813348454
509,Like what would you like to do after the game? And getting you know 16 different opinions and having to deal with that,0,0.30222748238379366
510,I'm getting like of small set of like you know options and we have people with dietary restrictions and things like that,1,0.7341612924740594
511,So uh I think that way it's just being able to get a couple of different opinions come to a conclusion before um making a decision,0,0.15455013832531528
512,That's been pretty successful,0,0.39245568688584626
513,one of my weaknesses might be um maybe voicing my opinion all the time,0,0.18755857915192653
514,Sometimes if I'm in a group with a lot of like loud personalities I might have um an opinion on a matter but not always want to voice it in the most,0,0.32230062042973917
515,I won't um word my feelings in the best way or be able to convey exactly my emotions um so I think working to do that and I think just through getting more leadership exposure and really pushing myself to get out there has been helping me overcome that,0,0.20919740887807237
516,I think that from freshman to now junior year that it definitely by taking more leadership roles on I've been able to become more vocal person to kind of like express my concerns,1,0.5737824960575687
517,I think you should hire me because I think I have a lot of uh technical or skills both um like bases off of my academic performance s,1,0.8088170427287866
518,I would have good but also more I feel like I work well with others,1,0.7642480901805394
519,I'm able to take initiative and if there's ever some sort of concern I've never had a pro with people coming to me to discuss it,0,0.271587471786791
520,Um I think I'm good at recognizing problems early before they get too uh become a good a big problem,0,0.3937983692193587
521,Um and kind of address them in a very professional manner and fix it um the problem can go over smoothly,0,0.2115156921086478
522,Good,1,0.9036480987850044
523,You?,0,0.13115931029929018
524,Yeah sorry I was- think I was late,1,0.7700714383290845
525,I totally like messed up,0,0.35729155202333646
526,I thought we were at the media lab,1,0.642912184984852
527,But,0,0.07018898356424853
528,Ahh hmm,0,0.2387154408523499
529,So uhh I would- would say that the job I’m interviewing for let’s stay down here,0,0.09444753853762607
530,So yeay I’m Chase and I guess um I don’t know,0,0.15455013832531528
531,I really enjoy computers and outdoors that’s -that’s generally what I give people,0,0.445823403679451
532,Um so in both of these um in computers mainly uhh at MIT I think some of my favorite classes have actually been graphics,0,0.34651595146154224
533,and computational photography as well,0,0.13457995866975905
534,So it’s actually been really interesting to me getting into harder problems,0,0.02142171260519209
535,Um like really deep programming like C I’m actually getting more interested in,0,0.23226963873358347
536,Whereas before when I came to MIT I had no idea about this stuff and I just did a lot of web-development,0,0.09444753853762607
537,Umm otherwise I just,0,0.3022838906250506
538,I really just enjoy working on random projects,0,0.31213544981287855
539,Going to Aca-thons [SP?] a lot and hanging out with people,0,0.2387154408523499
540,Umm yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
541,Just building cool things,0,0.39245568688584626
542,Uhh otherwise uhh my main thing I do afterwards is ultimate Frisbee which I really enjoy,0,0.23226963873358347
543,Uhh actually that would probably be,0,0.12001822993247584
544,I would actually put this on Frisbee,0,0.18051115217519223
545,Uhh so I started the Frisbee club in my high school um my junior year,0,0.3022838906250506
546,And umm basically it was just a bunch of my friends,0,0.09444753853762607
547,We used to play around a lot and we said “Hey why don’t we just make this a team?” It was about 15 or 20 of us,0,0.3887681302185169
548,Umm so I became captain and what that entailed was getting people to practices every day or maybe three times a week depending on like how people’s schedules were,1,0.5338463461786015
549,But it was definitely tricky because I mean we had to get you know at least 15 people out on the field to be able to actually play a game because you need 7 on each side,0,0.029398459550941756
550,Umm so uhh getting all this organized like everyday was umm definitely like pretty hard to do,0,0.2115156921086478
551,And I had to get people passionate enough to be wanting to play every time that we needed to play,0,0.25353811833686407
552,Umm and by the end uhh we went to a tournament in Texas,0,0.33141366362000685
553,which is where I’m from,0,0.3022838906250506
554,Umm and we got 5th my junior year and 3rd my senior year which is great without a coach or anything,1,0.5852163666581659
555,Umm just a lot of playing around with my friends yeah,0,0.3572911640991484
556,Uhh hmm OK,0,0.2387154408523499
557,So let’s- let’s go with robotics,0,0.07018898356424853
558,That was one of the classes I was in uhh last semester,0,0.3022838906250506
559,So umm basically uhh the first half of the class was just learning in general about robots,0,0.07018898356424853
560,And figuring out umm you know just like all the electronics first of all and then actually the computer sense behind it doing vision and such,0,0.06436505595457541
561,Umm so finally at the very end of the umm uhh class we had to make our own robots,0,0.33141366362000685
562,And so what I did there umm basically uhh we had a few meetings to figure out what type of robot we would be building and stuff,0,0.14153925129016182
563,Umm and I guess uhh what I wanted to do was umm basically go ahead with everything we’d already done,1,0.5455338645201713
564,Uhh and just push forward with that and just finish off basically,0,0.2387154408523499
565,And what my team members wanted to do was actually redo everything and start from the very bottom,0,0.015537124824823036
566,Umm so what we ended up doing I actually took their side umm and it worked out very well,0,0.1032468558164049
567,Umm we had uhh quite a few tricky problems involved like umm uhh one really cool thing we worked on was figuring out exactly umm how the robot can see the world,0,0.15572336604590054
568,and what we had with this we had a tile floor that we kind of cheated with,0,0.021642826481745682
569,We had a tile floor and then walls,0,0.33141366362000685
570,everywhere,0,0.2387154408523499
571,Umm so what we were able to do is say “Let’s just color the tile floor and wherever the coloring stops,0,0.33141366362000685
572,“So let’s look at all the light in the picture and whenever we don’t see any white that’s actually the bottom of the wall,0,0.14385601394430575
573,Umm yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
574,So then we basically took all these points that existed that represented roughly the bottom of the wall and then basically ran that through an algorhythm that created it uhh turned it into a line,0,0.13278584963937465
575,Umm so yeah,0,0.07018898356424853
576,That was- that was kind of what it was and it worked really well,0,0.17963402645220658
577,In the end we actually had this vision turned on which is really tricky and,0,0.0652265562111153
578,I think the first time they’d actually had umm some- something like this instead of just looking for balls and doing path planning,0,0.4429978114195979
579,Umm actually local- relocalization in the world,0,0.09607975816263775
580,Yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
581,OK uhh hmm,0,0.2387154408523499
582,One of my weaknesses? Umm I would go with umm,0,0.15248303418968046
583,umm,0,0.2387154408523499
584,Yeah I should’ve had a better answer for this question,1,0.5338463461786015
585,umm I guess,0,0.4316075683376617
586,I don’t know if I can plan to overcome it,0,0.4730831849790573
587,[laughing] I don’t know,0,0.3022838906250506
588,I- I- I’d actually say umm I- I wish I was a lot better in working- in working in teams,0,0.38535842737456816
589,Umm so I actually really enjoy working in teams in general and that’s umm actually been one of my biggest focuses at MIT because I just know everyone is like really great at everything,0,0.06788794010145202
590,Umm but being able to umm basically inspire people to do stuff that I think is a good idea,1,0.6100299707868481
591,Uhh I have found that I’m not the best at basically,0,0.4716025486650735
592,Umm uhh I mean just like just- just various aspects of just everything,0,0.4716025486650735
593,You know like working in this social club where we just throw offense in general for students and you know I’ve got like various ideas that I need to get across to people but sometimes people don’t agree with me and,1,0.5321423357125473
594,I either have to be persuasive or something or come up with better ideas,1,0.5724056014340263
595,Umm so I guess- I guess my plan to overcome this uhh so far has basically just been a lot of practice,0,0.4316075683376617
596,and just doing more uhh basically again like I’ve been doing a lot of teamwork in general,0,0.1768600974688769
597,I do really enjoy it,0,0.31213544981287855
598,So I think it just comes with practice and being very conscious about how other people do stuff very well and inspire me umm so hopefully I can inspire others,0,0.27356360199342006
599,Umm [laughs] uhh I guess because umm I- I would probably say the one word comes down to passion,1,0.7642480901805394
600,Umm I- whatever I’m doing I make sure umm to do it with everything that I have and I’m- I’m basically always thinking about the problems that I’m working on,0,0.2397396965153384
601,Umm I- I- I generally have like a pretty small scope of problems as well that I always try to narrow it down,0,0.49636385312367615
602,I’m not- I can’t take so many problems at the same time and try and solve all of them,0,0.21250816544335416
603,If I’m reading a book I’m only reading like one or two books,0,0.4716025486650735
604,Umm but with this umm I don’t know I- I- I’ve found it so far to be really helpful,0,0.38535842737456816
605,Umm I think my passion generally overflows to other people,1,0.6100299707868481
606,Umm I- I think I’m frequently jumping around uhh when I’m doing stuff,1,0.6114423030620092
607,and like explaining stuff and like listening to people,0,0.13457995866975905
608,Umm so I think I- I- I bring kind of some liveliness to places and also with this passion goes- I’m always looking at new stuff learning new stuff and- and teaching people about it umm and you know just enjoy making stuff,1,0.5045715944777942
609,Pretty well,0,0.39245568688584626
610,How are you?,0,0.15445987288440202
611,Um I'm Nikki,0,0.3022838906250506
612,I'm a course 6 major at MIT this year,0,0.3938730607112474
613,I live at east campus,0,0.3938730607112474
614,Um what do you want to know?,0,0.15445987288440202
615,I'm from Minnesota,0,0.3938730607112474
616,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
617,um,0,0.2387154408523499
618,I was in APO,0,0.3938730607112474
619,I was the fellowship vice president for a time,0,0.21250816544335416
620,I was responsible for organizing the [xx?],0,0.3938730607112474
621,basically it's limited to three sections,0,0.11521478613197428
622,Friendship leadership and service,0,0.2387154408523499
623,It was on my [xx?] organizing the events that,0,0.3022838906250506
624,helped to foster friendship among the brothers,0,0.39245568688584626
625,So we had this project a few weeks ago,0,0.1066093052570166
626,It was a [xx?] of [xx?] and one of our group-mates did the whole thing,0,0.33141366362000685
627,Yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
628,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
629,So we,0,0.1066093052570166
630,the other two of us we talked among ourselves to figure out what like had happened exactly because both of us are just kind of [xx?] really quickly,0,0.2571389984462586
631,And then arranged a meeting with the TA [xx?] to see if we could work out a solution and at the end it worked out okay,0,0.19732153176187164
632,It wasn't the best obviously because we hadn't gotten to do the work,1,0.5052336361306978
633,Resolved it,0,0.2387154408523499
634,I haven't had this kind of interview in forever,0,0.3938730607112474
635,I'm going to ask you to code,0,0.45888521649601605
636,I'm really quiet,0,0.31213544981287855
637,I just speak really quietly and it's because in my head it sounds louder than I guess it is,0,0.18134516056488517
638,I work on it,1,0.5724056014340263
639,I try to project and all that,0,0.3938730607112474
640,I ask people to tell me if I'm being too quiet cause I can't [xx?],1,0.6490718829987913
641,It's a real problem though,0,0.11521478613197428
642,For what? Uhm because I learn really quickly,0,0.061525215587393475
643,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
644,I bring a very positive attitude to the job and I like to have fun with what I do,1,0.6490718829987913
645,And I work hard at it and I don't what to let people down [xx?],0,0.08191717026182452
646,Good,1,0.9036480987850044
647,Yep,0,0.2387154408523499
648,Uh well I'm a Junior,0,0.4716025486650735
649,I'm an MIT student,0,0.3938730607112474
650,Um I'm majoring in both Math and Computer Science,0,0.3022838906250506
651,Uh what sort of skills and interests are you looking to find out about?,0,0.27342630663036205
652,Cool well I'm really interested in distributed systems actually and that's more of a research interest and the sort of application that it generally tends to have when I look at companies is parallel computing,1,0.8493100178312155
653,Um I actually did an internship last summer with Amazon and uh for them I ended up doing a lot of parallel computing with the hoodoo platform,0,0.12805425526188313
654,I'm also taking 6172 which is a performance engineering class and we do a lot of parallelism in C++,1,0.5067186044464734
655,Well uh this was in high school but in high school I was the uh president of our robotics team as well as the uh in the earlier years the head of respectively the the uh mechanical engineering team and our mechanical arm team,1,0.5852163666581659
656,Uh and you know that was a good leadership experience uh I've also been in uh in 6172 we have group projects - they're only two people - but um in some of the projects I've been the person doing a lot of the organizing,1,0.6480443715079547
657,Uh yeah um,0,0.2387154408523499
658,Are you more interested in a technical challenge or like in a working with people challenge?,0,0.45741044182905144
659,Okay,0,0.2387154408523499
660,Well um in my 6172 class I'm taking right now I was working with Jason,0,0.4716025486650735
661,He is a friend of mine and we were both working on the first project and we were trying to improve our speed in order to get up to the benchmark for like good fastness um of improvement,1,0.5852163666581659
662,And we had to prioritize different choices in terms of what might actually speed up our code by approximately five hundredfold,0,0.049342140267856965
663,Yeah it was pretty intense,0,0.2115156921086478
664,And we as such like had to sort of try and paralyze the work and you know it was pretty hard because the code - like merging two code documents is never fun and there was really only one document we were working on,0,0.04320927396406251
665,What ended up happening is that I spent most of the time uh driving which is to say coding him watching - verifying my algorithm,0,0.1620597888134149
666,It was stressful because it was getting close to the deadline and if we didn't finish this optimization we'd have to turn in an old version which was only ten times faster as opposed to five hundred times faster,0,0.2977831921157918
667,We ended up getting it not five hundred times faster but one hundred times faster,1,0.5052336361306978
668,I was quite pleased,1,0.6320398211835518
669,Working with him was sort of both working on the strategies of how to fix the technical problem as fast as possible given that we had two peoples' worth of manhours but only n actual hours,0,0.3523851046866215
670,Um and thinking about solutions to that technical problem was interesting,0,0.25606765850548896
671,Uh I when I get stressed tend to get a little snippy with people I'm working with,0,0.3022838906250506
672,I think it is not uncommon,1,0.532476616497347
673,Um but definitely when I'm - especially when I'm tired it's like 4 AM in the morning and I'm working with people,0,0.08191717026182452
674,When they're trying to explain something to me or I'm trying to explain something to them there's like inherent overhead and that can be very frustrating,0,0.2704138274778955
675,It causes me to like be short with people when like they're trying to explain things to me or I'm explaining things to them,0,0.4716025486650735
676,And it's something I'm working on because it doesn't actually make communication more effective it just makes everyone unhappy,0,0.02935760559696661
677,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
678,One of - so - there's a couple things one is that like I have to stay up late working on things so I inevitably get practice working at not being snippy,0,0.2704138274778955
679,Um but also like having recognized that this is something that I do something that is not effective for communication uh I have been trying to pay attention to um you know my tone of voice my friendliness and I've been trying to take the approach that when I do have to try to communicate in these situations to like optimize by minimizing the communication needed and being expressively relaxed during the periods of communication,0,0.21899413203219753
680,Because even if I need to be like working hard and stressing out about the work the communication portion doesn't need to take up much time,0,0.2704138274778955
681,And so if it takes like twice as long it doesn't matter because that's not the time you need to optimize,0,0.16870585012516354
682,I think you should hire me because I'm technically qualified I get along well with people I am interested in these fields,1,0.8088170427287866
683,Like I'm excited about Computer Science it's like what I want to do,0,0.4716025486650735
684,It's a large part of who I am - the Math and Computer Science part of me,0,0.3022838906250506
685,And as a result I'm going to enjoy work and enjoy working with people,0,0.1768600974688769
686,Um also the people I spend my time with outside of work will tend to be very similar kinds of people to the kinds of people I'll be interacting with at work,0,0.4716025486650735
687,And so it tends to work out pretty well,0,0.13457995866975905
688,In my previous internship with Amazon my team liked me a lot because I'm pretty laid back and enjoy joking around with people,1,0.5338463461786015
689,Bake food you know,0,0.2903869332990904
690,So I yeah you know I will solve your technical problems and I will get along with the team,0,0.02649117677626576
691,Good how are you?,1,0.8452898993011722
692,So I’m a junior in chemical engineering,0,0.09444753853762607
693,Im very interested in energy application so um from alternative energy to more traditional sources so basically oil fossil fuels,0,0.3938730607112474
694,Um and kind of optimizing that industry I think theres a lot of potential there so that’s that’s where my main interest is,0,0.4316075683376617
695,yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
696,Um so im uh vice president of corporalations (sp) for the society of woman engineers,0,0.15248303418968046
697,And um we just held in September a career fair banquet,0,0.19732153176187164
698,So we had a dinner for about 200 people following the career fair,0,0.19732153176187164
699,Um and its it’s a huge event to organize in the sense that students need to be matched up with companies that suit their interest for dinner,0,0.2387154408523499
700,so the goal is just to have kind of a relaxed networking event after you know the hecticness of the carrerr fair,0,0.16870585012516354
701,and and to just give people a chance to talk,0,0.07018898356424853
702,Um and so so I was working with a committee of six people and which I was the leader of and um I think one thing that I I really did to make sure that the event went smoothly was delegate tasks very early on,1,0.5235537960611565
703,Um so one of the one of things that happened in the previous years when I was one of the team and not leading the,0,0.4716025486650735
704,team was it became very disorganized because we didn’t know what the other tasks were what the other people were doing,0,0.17070910373751436
705,and in the end we ended up having to work throughout the event to keep things running smoothly and I wanted the team members to be able to sit down and have dinner as well,0,0.25353811833686407
706,so in the end it ended up running very well um and um kind of we all got to have dinner to so that was awesome,0,0.19732153176187164
707,um so one of our senior design or not our senior but one of our design classes within chemical engineering,0,0.33141366362000685
708,um asks us to design uh chemical plant in one of the uh software programs we use,0,0.33141366362000685
709,um and so it’s a very big project,0,0.2387154408523499
710,but its very modular,0,0.07018898356424853
711,So you can have somebody working on distillation columns and somebody working on the (sp) separator,0,0.08967900877249617
712,Um and so one of the challenges um within that um is making sure that everyone is keeping up with their um their part of the project,0,0.2387154408523499
713,and so one challenge that I faced with that project was making sure that one particular person was thou rally involved because um its a lot of work today and we cant really afford to have any anyone kind of slacking off,0,0.1032468558164049
714,um so kind of to addrses that problem I sat down with him had a conversation with him about it you know we are all feeling kind of the strain of this project the deadline is coming,0,0.12043335406230594
715,Um but um you know we cant have anyone sitting on the sidelines so what is it that you want to get more involved in or where do you think your skills are? And it turned out that um he wasn’t very um he wasn’t very comfortable writing the code in the program,0,0.2006437780282621
716,So he didn’t want to write bunky code and just have somebody else try to fix his work all the time but he was very tight with the teaching assistants and so he could funnel our questions through them and getr us some good answers um back from them so that we could keep going through the project so through that conversation we found a way for him to contribute,0,0.19732153176187164
717,I think um kind of within my personality,1,0.6114423030620092
718,I hacve a lot of a lot of go go go and uh and a lot of times I don’t um realize that waiting is the best option you know just letting certain events take their course um may in fact be the best option,1,0.5121648375477725
719,Um so kind of to give you a good example of this is um when I was trying to decide which internships um or which internship offerse to accept I kind of was very anxious to kind of pick one and go with it um and kinf of get started in meeting people,0,0.3260083851308101
720,In that company and figuring ouit what I wanted to do and um I think in that circumstance it would have been better after I had accepted an offer I I got other offers that I of course couldn’t consider because I was already tied to one particular offer and in that circumstance it would have been better to wait to see how things panned out,1,0.6100299707868481
721,And to just communicate with other people saying that you know I really do think that pushing the deadline is the best,0,0.14280139447180404
722,Option in this circumstance,0,0.2387154408523499
723,So kind of this year now I definitely waited for everything to pan out before making a decision,0,0.04151446662050083
724,Um and it has worked out really well actually,0,0.17963402645220658
725,I I was very tempted to give a response to one of the offers I received,0,0.4730831849790573
726,But over this last weekend I actually went to a conference um and it changed my mind,0,0.03414728906078335
727,Both companies that I was deciding between was at the conference,0,0.3022838906250506
728,And talking to the representatives really helped me,0,0.05007391579932511
729,So im glad that I waited to you know hit the buttons,0,0.21899413203219753
730,-I think that I have a uh ability to contribute really well to the group so not just bringing the knowledge um or the skills that are,0,0.34651595146154224
731,In your job description but also kind of the enthusiasms,0,0.2903869332990904
732,T he willingness to contribute my ideas to the,0,0.4716025486650735
733,Uh huh,0,0.2387154408523499
734,Discussion and um really emerge myself in whats going on would make me a stellar candidate I think,0,0.34651595146154224
735,I'm uh pretty good,1,0.5724056014340263
736,The weather's nice uh outside,0,0.39245568688584626
737,Okay so I'm a Junior,0,0.3022838906250506
738,I'm a Junior at IT,0,0.3938730607112474
739,Going to graduate uh a semester early actually,0,0.09607975816263775
740,So I'm going to be graduating next fall,0,0.04151446662050083
741,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
742,Because uh,0,0.2387154408523499
743,I I've been doing my my work pretty quickly I guess so I,0,0.43832997198318147
744,So uh I can graduate early that's a good thing,0,0.1768600974688769
745,Um I'm interested in going into nutrition in the long run,0,0.3022838906250506
746,Uh whether it be through medical school or you know even a certification,0,0.2903869332990904
747,Whatever but I uh in the meantime I want to get into Life Sciences consulting,0,0.3022838906250506
748,And I want to um explore the field and and and uh yeah,0,0.09444753853762607
749,do it as as soon as I can pretty much as long as I can,0,0.4716025486650735
750,In the field,0,0.2387154408523499
751,Um being successful,0,0.39245568688584626
752,Uh and getting somewhere,0,0.2387154408523499
753,Uh,0,0.2387154408523499
754,So,0,0.07018898356424853
755,Uh yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
756,Okay so I am President of the Endometrius Society and last year we organized a networking event so uh that that comprised of not only students but also like working professionals in the Boston area so basically I got in touch with and invited every single Armenian that I knew in the Boston area and it ended up being a hundred plus event that we actually coordinated in one of the dorms here in Bexley hall so it was also a lot of logistical um you know like practice getting over uh getting around the rules and stuff with capacity and everything and whether or not to serve alcohol and all that stuff,0,0.1616335607299572
757,So uh that that was a very big event and uh it was very successfully because people were still talking about it today,0,0.13457995866975905
758,So,0,0.07018898356424853
759,Thank you,1,0.9723827022850665
760,Okay so I'm also involved in MIT Undergraduate research journal and uh last spring we we we we publish twice a year at the end of each semester and last spring um we were a little late in our uh in our uh timeline so it was kind of near finals week and we still hadn't gotten anything published,0,0.4064865837293959
761,So uh sorry this was last fall so we still had the spring semester to uh sort of remediate our uh error,0,0.3448299883627301
762,So um we kind of um all you know pitched in together and I guess the main thing we had to uh draw upon was each other's initiative like in the whole process and motivation and motivation you know for some people it's more self-centered and for others it's more of a community motivation you know? And we each had to tap into our individual editors' motivation you know what kind of people they were what they were looking for et cetera so we had to get people kind of uh self started in a way,0,0.43722042557844615
763,And uh yeah we we got to work really quickly and uh and and we had it published by like the first two weeks of the spring semester so uh,0,0.07692020109018043
764,yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
765,yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
766,It was a good skill that I picked up kind of how to tap into people's sense of initiative and stuff,0,0.4716025486650735
767,So,0,0.07018898356424853
768,Yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
769,Uh,0,0.2387154408523499
770,Yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
771,So uh one of my weakness I think is uh like well shyness,0,0.1352367738043197
772,You know um um and I may see a little like confident you know on the outside but um I definitely have my moments where I'm like you know I just freeze and I feel like so you know like I can't talk to anyone pretty much you know and it's like it's like maybe ten percent of the time that I'm like that but uh I kinda want to like get rid of that completely so yeah I'm just I'm doing I'm like putting myself into more like challenging situations socially and stuff to kind of like overcome it,0,0.16916775686781269
773,So um yeah just like you know taking advantage of every opportunity that comes my way to be social and stuff like going to parties and just being used to being around people because definitely at MIT you can become like socially uh you know like blocked away so,0,0.26459270552821346
774,Yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
775,Um so I draw upon a lot of leadership experiences with my enrollment at MIT student groups um I've completed three years of MIT without going insane that's just a joke but um um,0,0.15248303418968046
776,and I'm very you know like um I'm very organized I'm a self-starter I'm you know I take initiative I've organized a lot of events through these student groups so I'm I'm um I'm definitely able to take upon like large tasks with being organized and you know very like having initiative,0,0.21899413203219753
777,So yeah,0,0.07018898356424853
778,I'm doing pretty well,1,0.5724056014340263
779,I'm a Junior in course two [?unknown word?],0,0.21250816544335416
780,I just started going to last semester but I got very interested in product design when I took a class called product design,0,0.17772661287718336
781,It was really cool because we got to work in small teams to make our own projects,0,0.2571389984462586
782,So ours was a toy called Con[?] Control and my main role is to do a lot of the solid worksing[?] so I make a lot of the CAD 3-D modeling so that we could make the physical components that didn't already exsist,0,0.25353811833686407
783,I really enjoyed that because it's kind of an intersection between designing a part and engineering which I have never really thought of until last year,1,0.5235537960611565
784,Outside of classes I try to do a lot of design work as well maybe in somewhat different fields,1,0.5338463461786015
785,Like I work for the Tech as a production editor,0,0.4716025486650735
786,So It's a lot of making info graphics and laying out the entire newspaper and making it look really pretty,0,0.05007391579932511
787,It's kind of a good break though from equations and things like that,0,0.2115156921086478
788,I think a very recent example is I am going to be chair of my sorority so we just held an event called catwalk which is ten months of planning but it took a lot of delegation a lot of staying on top of things because there's so many components they needed to coordinate,1,0.8367235883167741
789,We ended up having fourteen designers but we had to contact way more than that from around the Boston area,0,0.3887681302185169
790,And the sorority has a hundred forty girls in it so all of them has to participate in some way whether it's working with a designer or helping me to create the decoration scheme or logistics,0,0.13457995866975905
791,I personally think it ran really smoothly as a result of extreme organization,0,0.4429978114195979
792,I had a co-chair and another girl helping me organize it and we got very good at creating tabs on Google Docs to stay on top of things,0,0.33750214762425196
793,If I may I'll go back to toy product design 'cause I think that was a really good good example,0,0.34651595146154224
794,I think all of us--it was a team of three freshmen and two sophomores--none of us had that much experience with product design at all so we were all bringing different skills to the table and different ideas different preferences and visions for what we wanted to do and they clashed a lot in the beginning,1,0.642912184984852
795,It was really difficult for us like our personalities clashed as well not just our ideas which was really difficult to work with because meetings were unproductive and we just felt like we weren't moving anywhere because other teams were moving forward with their ideas prototyping things and we were still arguing over what design would be most feasible or what was interesting,0,0.201241396039797
796,So we worked through that by just--we worked with our mentors talking to them as kind of a mediator so it wasn't a completely self-motivated resolution or self--I don't know how to describe it,0,0.25353811833686407
797,But it ended up working out we all kind of slowed down took a step back and saw from eachother's perspectives talked out very explicitly what the plus and minuses of each idea were and what our goals were given the constraints of the class being that we had a two hundred dollar budget and just a semester to complete it in,0,0.04721556736134647
798,And at this point like a month left to go,0,0.13457995866975905
799,And in the end we just recognized eachother's strengths and we could each take on responsibility for a certain component of the toy and figure out a way to just meld them all together into the final product,0,0.1066093052570166
800,And we did by the end,0,0.1066093052570166
801,We had something that we were really proud of,0,0.2571389984462586
802,Like a lot of teams ended up relying a lot on their mentors to kind of do the project for them but because we each wanted to take so much ownership of the project it was very much our own and we were able to present it on the final day and that's something that was very rewarding,1,0.5052336361306978
803,I think one of my weaknesses is my--I forget what it is called,0,0.39521743774958146
804,Oh lack of assertiveness or lack of confidence in a way,0,0.2115156921086478
805,Like I always want to make sure that everyone's ideas are heard and I feel like lots of times I don't want to create conflict so I'll kind of back down after a little bit,0,0.1352367738043197
806,I'm very open to sharing my ideas but if there's a lot of criticism then I will back down and that's something that I'm working on a lot like just trying to stand behind my own ideas trying to be more objective about them so I have reasons to resent so that I don't feel like there's any reason for me to need to back down,1,0.5737824960575687
807,I think you should hire me because I am very passionate about product design,1,0.8088170427287866
808,I feel like it's something that people told me when I started the mechanical engineering lessons they were like Oh you just lit up and I can see that you found your passion here,1,0.8088170427287866
809,I feel like I'm very detail oriented so I'm able to create CAD models in a very methodical manner instead of just drawing random things together,0,0.43832997198318147
810,I'm able to think of design for manufacturing overall and not just what looks nice on paper but what's actually practicable,0,0.36798992100707234
811,I think I am a great team player in that even though I can be passive sometimes in a way it's good to have people with different levels of aggressiveness and different levels of confidence because that way it's not all like butting heads all the time,1,0.5737824960575687
812,And I think that as I improve in my own smoothly and not confrontationally with people but also get things done very effectively,0,0.27356360199342006
813,I'm good,1,0.5724056014340263
814,How are you?,0,0.15445987288440202
815,Ok well i'm a junior at MIT and I'm currently studying Computer Science and Biology,0,0.4716025486650735
816,It's a new joint major with a minor in management,0,0.2387154408523499
817,So that's a little bit of my background,0,0.09444753853762607
818,Um last summer I worked at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco,0,0.4716025486650735
819,I was in their principal investing group,0,0.3938730607112474
820,So I was investing in a lot of longer term securities,0,0.09444753853762607
821,So it was like buy side trading,0,0.13457995866975905
822,Ok so my freshman year um I was doing this project called Six Four Seventy and this is during IEP,0,0.3022838906250506
823,It's like a competition where you're supposed to get a team and design your on website,1,0.5196231351181234
824,So it was like the first time that all of us had been doing this kind of programming before,0,0.19732153176187164
825,Well I had a little background but not much,0,0.4716025486650735
826,Um and basically at the end of the day it came to me to get the team together because everyone was doing other things,0,0.2387154408523499
827,And it's IEP everyone is trying to have fun also,0,0.13457995866975905
828,Then I was like guys we have deadlines,0,0.25353811833686407
829,We need to get a B in this,0,0.33141366362000685
830,So basically I stepped into a leadership roll and I brought our team together and we managed to finish our project and pass the class,0,0.14153925129016182
831,It didn't win any of us awards but at least we finished it,1,0.5052336361306978
832,I guess that is kind of related to my previous example,1,0.6114423030620092
833,I can talk more in depth about it I guess,1,0.6114423030620092
834,Um so I guess our main issue was getting the back end database to work correctly,1,0.5066404005866445
835,Um which none of us had ever programmed with like MySQL or any of those languages before you know,1,0.5713018750224388
836,So um I basically tried to delegate tasks,0,0.09444753853762607
837,So I made one of my friends set up the uh get hub server and then another friend,0,0.09444753853762607
838,I said ok just try to focus on like the matching algorithms,1,0.5724056014340263
839,Then I'll try to put all these things together and create like the front end of the website and bring all the code together and yeah,0,0.1768600974688769
840,So that was my team experience,0,0.09444753853762607
841,I think one of my weaknesses is um when I am working on a team sometimes I try to do too much myself,0,0.39521743774958146
842,Um like sometimes like people are say: oh what can I help you with? but if they had previously shown inconsistency in the past then I'll try to get it done on my own and not really like delegate things to them so yeah,0,0.04820567998232772
843,That's something I need to work on I think,1,0.6100299707868481
844,Uh to overcome it I am trying to be a better leader,0,0.4716025486650735
845,Um I am actually going through this leadership uh program right now,0,0.23226963873358347
846,It's called CCLP so that's been helping me a lot with my leadership skills,0,0.4716025486650735
847,I think you should hire me because I have the necessary background experience,1,0.6725207706449717
848,Um from my past summers at uh Wells Fargo and also because I can get work done,0,0.4716025486650735
849,I will work well on a team but at the end of the day if things aren't getting done I will over-compensate and do it myself,1,0.6490718829987913
850,So you can count on me to meet the deadlines necessary at your firm,0,0.08967900877249617
851,Huh pretty well how are you?,0,0.45741044182905144
852,Um i am a junior in course 18 which is applied math,0,0.3022838906250506
853,Uh Obviously I go to MIT uhm,0,0.3022838906250506
854,whoops sorry,1,0.5803657338044622
855,I'm also probably going to major in management science uhm as well as I'm really interested in minoring in economics,0,0.445823403679451
856,Um outsie of academics I do a lot of sports I play water polo I rock clmb a lot uhm I run and bike a lot and uh I'm involved in lots of random clubs at MIT so I like to keep busy,0,0.3080838209192851
857,Uhm well I've been swimming well I was a varsity swimmer in hs as well as college uhm so I swam competitively for 15 years,0,0.1768600974688769
858,Uhm so I was the captain of my high school as well as my summer club swim team,0,0.4716025486650735
859,Uhm leadership wise I guess the summer swim team was where I felt like I had had the most influential leadership position,1,0.6100299707868481
860,Uhm just because I was on the same team for 14 years,0,0.3022838906250506
861,Uhm and so I really got to develop my relationships with all of the younger swimmers uhm even before I was in an official captain position,0,0.12805425526188313
862,Oh um so I did a lot of uh uh coaching of younger kids uhm a lot of team management as in like setting up events setting up meets heping meets and everything running smoothly uhm as well as just leading you know cheers helping people stay focus and stay organized at practices,1,0.5380555749984539
863,Hm well I was on the financial metrics team in my internship last summer which was basically just the quantitative analysis team,0,0.4716025486650735
864,Uhm and so we had a problem in one of our like quantitative analysis programs that was running and non one really knew where it was coming from,0,0.12568037976852317
865,So as a team we uh like divide and conquer broke down uh individual sections of the program to look at and uh correlated those with each persons expertise so I analyzed mainly the R portion whereas um my teammate my coworker and lets me lead my sequel portion of the code and broke it up that way I guess,0,0.19821442239249298
866,Yeah eventually,0,0.2387154408523499
867,With help from the uh finance expert,0,0.2387154408523499
868,Uhm Hm,0,0.2387154408523499
869,I would say one of my weaknesses is that I don't always push myself hard enough uhm as far as academically,0,0.43441758665660263
870,I like to be challenged but I don't always seek those out,0,0.3080838209192851
871,Um so to overcome that I have done a lot of searching through the MIT coursework to uhm find classes that look interesting as well as challenging and to sign up for a lot of classes that are outside just the minimum major requirements so that I could get a bit more of a challenge instead of just doing the bare minimum,0,0.2704138274778955
872,Uhm because I'm a very fast learner,0,0.4716025486650735
873,Um I'm dedicated and I know how to work hard because it's something that I've done for my entire life and uh I like being busy and I like working hard,0,0.2704138274778955
874,So if I'm given a task I'll work hard until its done well,0,0.08191717026182452
875,Pretty good,0,0.39245568688584626
876,Uhh so I'm a junior uhh studying aeronautics and astronautics at MIT,0,0.3022838906250506
877,Umm so right now I'm currently in the middle of my junior year,0,0.4716025486650735
878,I'm looking for a summer internship company and uhh-,0,0.3938730607112474
879,OK,0,0.2387154408523499
880,Umm so for example last year umm when we were working on a class project where we were uhh trying to design a G- uhh sorry a jet engine for GE,1,0.6861565980426575
881,Umm I had to work with a group of 4 people umm and to try to optimize certain uhh certain parameters for this engine,0,0.4716025486650735
882,Uhh- that we would have to present at uhh something to present to GE engineers,0,0.33141366362000685
883,Umm during that time one of my team members uhh actually got really sick and he actually had to uhh go medical for a couple days and he wasn't really able to do much,0,0.057481900992564096
884,And uhh another person ended up uhh sh- wasn't showing up very much so during that time I sort of basically had to facilitate uhh the people who weren't sick uhh and basically help them communicate talk to each other and set up meetings,0,0.08191717026182452
885,Uhh I sort of took the helm on uhh towards uhh towards the end on a lot of that and basically got everybody together to to complete this project,0,0.3022838906250506
886,Umm uhh umm so over the summer I was working at at Auburn University,0,0.3022838906250506
887,Um I was doing uhh UAV collision avoidance algorithms,0,0.3022838906250506
888,So like uhh programming things to allow to allow a whole bunch of UAVs flying in the same airspace uhh to basically get to their directives without crashing into each other,0,0.060661407047331486
889,Umm I was working with a partner but in a larger context of umm a dozen students,0,0.3022838906250506
890,Umm as it turns out umm the challenge in this case was that although it was sort of like a programming AI sort of aeronautics umm sort of project uhh my partner came from a chemical engineering background and did not really have any programming experience nor she had she had experience with umm with sort of UAV design,0,0.23226963873358347
891,Umm so that became a bit of an issue umm but umm I think basically what ended up happening was I worked with umm a grad student there and like all the people to basically bring her up to speed,0,0.1352367738043197
892,Basically sort of teach her programming from the ground up up to a level where she might be able to help with programming like in a uhh a uhh for UAV,0,0.45321313756248316
893,And umm in that case I drew upon a lot of resources that were available there,0,0.1768600974688769
894,Umm you know there were grad students who were helping helping us the professor who was in charge of the ex- uhh the project as well as with other students in the program,1,0.5713018750224388
895,Ummm so I think one of my weaknesses is that umm I have a tendency to to show up uhh to things kind to things kind of late,0,0.2397396965153384
896,Umm this is actually probably after I'm used to after I'm used to going to a certain place umm because I have a tendency to think that and especially in the mornings because I have a tendency to think oh I can get to a certain place uhh by biking uhh at a certain speed,0,0.15856178830056442
897,So I think uhh what I tend to do uhh what I'm trying to do nowadays to try to overcome that is basically get to somewhere before hand and then basically uhh do work there as opposed to try to do work umm away from a place where I need to be and like sort of try to make it there in the nick of time,0,0.27356360199342006
898,It's something that I've tried to implement over the past couple weeks,0,0.3022838906250506
899,Umm I think you should hire me because umm basically I've demonstrated over the past couple years umm a fair amount of research experience a fair amount of experience in and out umm in and out of the classroom in both umm sort of an academic setting and in a research and development setting uhh such that I think I would be an asset to your company,1,0.6712110669180035
900,Umm I think that my past experience with both uhh software and hardwares in aeronautics makes it so that uhh I have a good balance that would be useful to you,1,0.6712110669180035
901,Um so I'm a junior at MIT,0,0.3022838906250506
902,I'm in aerospace engineering,0,0.3938730607112474
903,Um I'm thinking of doing more of the the aeronautics side rather than the astronautics side although I don't have to decide until later,0,0.4316075683376617
904,Um I'm in ROTC and you know in the Air Force portion,0,0.3611869277514505
905,I'm hoping to become a pilot,0,0.3938730607112474
906,Uh I applied pretty recently and I'll find out maybe in February or March of next year,0,0.21611320583280333
907,Um I'm also in Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity,0,0.3022838906250506
908,Our house is on the East campus across the river and I've been living there since I was a sophomore,0,0.4064865837293959
909,Um that's that's basically me,0,0.2387154408523499
910,Um so probably the biggest chance I got to demonstrate leadership so far in my life has been this past summer when I went to pretty much ROTC's version of boot camp,1,0.5338463461786015
911,It's called field training and it's about a month long and it's in Alabama,0,0.2387154408523499
912,And it's pretty much a test to see what you'd do in really stressful situations,0,0.027774583786133806
913,So uh they'd give us pretty big things like we'd have to be in charge of 40 or 50 people and we'd have to make sure they got to this place at the right time and then do um I guess the correct action when we get there,0,0.3731609464718653
914,And make sure nobody's going astray or making sure that like all the obstacles the instructors set up uh we can overcome them,0,0.0926304816353907
915,So being in charge of people for a good two or three days when everything is just so high stress is probably um the most challenging leadership experience I've ever had,0,0.10272802370478028
916,Um hm to give I guess a non-ROTC-related example um as we have a decent amount of projects in um Core 16 like Unified is a lot is very project based in the second semester and um one of the biggest problems we had in our specific group was the way that um I guess the work was being allocated,1,0.5066404005866445
917,So at first it was supposed to be um very evenly divided so each person on the four-person team would do a quarter of the work,0,0.16634557565434505
918,But um some people started doing a little bit less and some people started doing a little bit more,0,0.07018898356424853
919,And by the middle of the semester it was very unequal,0,0.030395260313939607
920,And so it was kind of getting you know under everyone's skin,0,0.08967900877249617
921,So as a group after we um we realized that it just wouldn't it was really a detriment to our productivity we all had a group meeting and said listen this is what we have to do,0,0.016520536803682564
922,We have to reallocate the certain things that are um are the parts of the project that um we had we wanted to originally and um it just kind of went astray,0,0.04721556736134647
923,So we did that and we became a lot better,0,0.19732153176187164
924,Um working on a team faced with a challenge,0,0.2387154408523499
925,Um hm,0,0.2387154408523499
926,I can think of um try to not um hit the same categories,1,0.532476616497347
927,So um in SAE in the fraternity that I'm in last semester I was the recruitment chair,0,0.09444753853762607
928,So the the job for the recruitment chair is essentially to plan Rush,0,0.08830690875445948
929,Like plan our events for CPW plan our events for fall rush plan our events for spring rush for a full calendar year or for a full school year excuse me,1,0.8183108846194453
930,Um and the question was challenges in a group right?,0,0.39245568688584626
931,Okay,0,0.2387154408523499
932,So challenges and teamwork,0,0.07018898356424853
933,So rush is very team-oriented because you're trying to work with your brothers to um really see I guess which freshmen uh are the most compatible with your fraternity,0,0.14280139447180404
934,And that you'd probably have the best time with,0,0.2066034157898696
935,So the way I set it up was we actually did work in small teams of about 4 or 5 brothers and we'd go out and you know do fun things and meet freshmen,0,0.13062676423831393
936,I would say the biggest problem with that during rush is that some teams were a lot more active than others,0,0.21250816544335416
937,And the team that I was in uh was a little bit less active and of course as being rush chair I didn't want that to be the case,0,0.09444753853762607
938,I wanted to change that,0,0.3938730607112474
939,So um especially in situations where you don't have um you don't have like hard given not given but like outlined powers,0,0.07772698000874113
940,Like you're not someone's boss,0,0.45741044182905144
941,You're just like another brother in the fraternity,0,0.2372142273492121
942,Um the best kind of way to convince people to do something that you want to do is through positive motivation,0,0.45741044182905144
943,So that's what I ended up using a lot to get for a while as rush chair to get people to go out,0,0.09444753853762607
944,So it was all always being like very excited to do it and like knowing that you're passionate about it and telling them or and like having them realize that oh this is a really good thing that we should be doing,0,0.12245197301210003
945,And it will really help us out and it will be fun,0,0.07692020109018043
946,So that's how I solved that problem,0,0.04151446662050083
947,So my greatest weakness,0,0.08191717026182452
948,I normally would probably have to think a lot more about,0,0.45468571979582034
949,But I actually had a similar conversation with um one of my bosses in ROTC about a month and a half ago,0,0.03414728906078335
950,So I would say my greatest weakness is when I get put in really stressful situations I will tend to jump to a decision or a conclusion too quickly and won't necessarily think about or I think through the whole process um like to fruition,0,0.05034229212330959
951,I'll kind of like hurry up and want to get to something so um so the situation can be like I guess resolved,0,0.43832997198318147
952,So what I'm working on is just being able to like even in a stressful situation and I know it is a problem to kind of slow down and take a step back and really like at things kind of from a higher altitude,0,0.013321799489899058
953,Um I'm a really hard worker,0,0.057481900992564096
954,I absolutely will devote myself to um this company,0,0.4730831849790573
955,I I think as a team member I'm very cooperative,1,0.7642480901805394
956,Uh if the goal we have as a team if I agree with it and for the most part I will,1,0.5866576737975321
957,And if I won't then I'll voice and like I'll voice my concerns and try to make it something everyone can agree on,0,0.08191717026182452
958,And if I agree on it um then I am or I'll definitely be able to participate in the team in a very productive manner,0,0.1768600974688769
959,I'll be a very good follower and if um if it's needed I can be a very good leader as well,1,0.6490718829987913
960,All right,0,0.39245568688584626
961,Sure so I'm a senior at MIT in management and computer science,0,0.3022838906250506
962,Uhm I'm really interested in the intersection of the two,0,0.12805425526188313
963,So you know not just uhm you know how computers can you know you know how like the best algorithms to do about computers? like you know inventing the next algorithm the next compression algorithm not really something that I'm interested in doing,0,0.19898713137219892
964,But uh really finding how computers can help apply to peoples lives and make new businesses or improve existing businesses,0,0.05007391579932511
965,Sure so uhm I guess I'd say earlier this year,0,0.4316075683376617
966,So I'm actually the president of Baker house and earlier in the beginning of the year in MIT we had this process called REX; Residence Exploration where all the dorms try and throw events and somehow you know recruit or retain the freshmen that they have,0,0.06797865758111087
967,Uhm and the REX Event that we had uh we threw a bunch of events had about ten workers that we had were able to give early arrival to,0,0.33141366362000685
968,So free housing,0,0.13457995866975905
969,Uh so we ran about five or six events the largest of which was a party where we had over seven-hundred people attend,0,0.33141366362000685
970,Sure,0,0.2387154408523499
971,So I think there's you know always been challenges,0,0.19261288316730724
972,So last summer when I was at Disney uhm there were there was some disagreement about uh how we should when we should schedule the uh what week we should schedule the uh trial for,0,0.10714651126468565
973,Uhm and there was some disagreement about whether we should have it later because of uhm uh dates for when the program would be ready but if we had it passed a certain date then we'd have to have the app also consider time zone issues,0,0.3523851046866215
974,So basically just discussed with all the stake holders and let them know that you know by changing this date pushing it back we're adding scope to the app and we're going to have to make additional development changes and see if they would be able to be flexible to change it back,0,0.2428917736095061
975,Yep,0,0.2387154408523499
976,Sure,0,0.2387154408523499
977,So I think the the problem uhm that I have the most is uh in delegating task to people,0,0.0705571610152508
978,So uhm I want to make sure that things are done properly so I tend to overly control on things,0,0.1768600974688769
979,So basically I've been thinking to myself alright is this something core that I really have to do? no,0,0.058349808998298384
980,I think let's,1,0.532476616497347
981,you know lets get someone else to do it and that way also they also they learn it so you know when I graduate they're able to take on that role,0,0.21395836163353454
982,Sure,0,0.2387154408523499
983,Sure,0,0.2387154408523499
984,I think uhm I combine you know technical expertise with uh business expertise and product expertise,1,0.6725207706449717
985,So hiring me as a product manager for your mobile app I think is uh would be optimal because I have expertise in all these areas and I've worked in all these areas in the past uhm and I'm able to bring that expertise to your organization in a way that I think few other candidates uhm have,0,0.32951325534129816
986,Thank you for having me,1,0.9723827022850665
987,Okay um my name's Evan Evan Muray I'm a junior here at MIT in computer science,0,0.3022838906250506
988,I'm originally from Louisville Kentucky,0,0.3938730607112474
989,And uh yeah I currently live across the river,0,0.09444753853762607
990,I heard about this study through e-mail,0,0.3938730607112474
991,So thought I'd check it out,0,0.118032441819917
992,You did?,0,0.13115931029929018
993,Nice,1,0.9036480987850044
994,A leader? Uh sure,0,0.2387154408523499
995,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
996,A good example of that would be uh some of my extra curricular work activities so I'm involved in uh two activities in general that showcase my leadership skills,0,0.4716025486650735
997,One is Camp Kesem MIT which is a student organization here on campus at MIT uh each summer the organization puts on a summer camp for children who's parents have or have had cancer,0,0.11521478613197428
998,Um and I serve on the coordinator board for this organization,0,0.3022838906250506
999,Um in the past I was in charge of handling applications and contacting families of campers who'd would come to our camp and being in contact with them throughout the year send them newsletters send them updates plan reunions for them,0,0.4064865837293959
1000,Uh this year I am in charge of asking the students on campus and getting students to apply to become counselors for our camp and (inaudible) with students so I work as a coordinator I actually have a co-coordinator we usually work in tandem,0,0.2030872096727455
1001,The other activity is dance troop,0,0.2387154408523499
1002,It's another student organization here at MIT where we put on a show each year and dance have some fun it's a dance show and I'm a choreography for that organization as well,0,0.25353811833686407
1003,I lead a dance teach people some dance moves for some fun,1,0.5724056014340263
1004,Thanks,1,0.929060350894491
1005,Sure uh I think a great example of that would be this past January I participated in a web design competition here on campus 6470 I was on a team with my girlfriend and a mutual friend of ours,1,0.6100299707868481
1006,It's always different working in a group with your friends as opposed to just hanging out with them,0,0.2903869332990904
1007,There was a bit of conflict about how we wanted the website to go,0,0.17070910373751436
1008,We had different visions for how we wanted it to look and I think for me the best way that I handled that was to sort of be willing to compromise because I think it's a very important skill and also just listening active listening,1,0.7120528119563496
1009,I was listening to why she wanted to make certain changes to the website,0,0.3938730607112474
1010,And by doing that um I was able to uh figure out uh sort of like a common ground that we could work towards I think we eventually did hit um and were able to move forward with this one conflict that I definitely remember because it was pretty big at the time but I mean we needed to get through it,0,0.19821442239249298
1011,My greatest weakness,0,0.35729155202333646
1012,Hm,0,0.2387154408523499
1013,Okay,0,0.2387154408523499
1014,Uh,0,0.2387154408523499
1015,I'd say my one of my bigger weaknesses is uh I'd say probably uh self-starting actually,0,0.13954120124038444
1016,It's something I've been working it's like my goal for this year to work on,0,0.4716025486650735
1017,In the past I would do my classes take my classes and really just kind of do my schoolwork significantly outside of classes,0,0.12805425526188313
1018,If there's one thing I learned from being around all these amazing people here at MIT is if you have an idea just go for it,1,0.5991253810632329
1019,It's very easy especially here there's resources to do so and it's something that I want to work on I have some ideas for projects I want to start on my own,0,0.4716025486650735
1020,It's always been an issue for me to actually start on things and come up with ideas and really get started on certain projects,0,0.04227461487187685
1021,But this I plan on starting my own website and doing some ideas with that and hopefully I will gain some more experience in computer sciences,0,0.1768600974688769
1022,Uh I think one of my best qualities is the ability to really quickly coming to MIT for example I came to MIT with very little experience in the field computer science,0,0.34651595146154224
1023,Many of my past internships I've been going to I don't have much experience but I pride myself in the sort of grasp ideas quickly and uh build on top of those and use those to build solutions to problems,0,0.08191717026182452
1024,I find that uh after doing some examples of a certain problem or just playing around with it for a little bit I can get to work on using that sort of technology,0,0.49636385312367615
1025,In the past couple internships I've had to deal with new languages new framework and I think that definitely more then compensates for any experience I'm lacking,0,0.2397396965153384
1026,No problem thank you for having me,1,0.9359857967995406
1027,Pretty good how are you?,0,0.45741044182905144
1028,So uh my name's Bonnie,0,0.09444753853762607
1029,I'm a junior at MIT,0,0.3938730607112474
1030,I'm in core six which if you don't know is in computer science,0,0.45888521649601605
1031,I'm minoring in economics umm also mathematics,0,0.3938730607112474
1032,So I'm interested in you know application of data and quantitative reasoning to any sort of like interesting fields so that includes like economics finance biology,0,0.21899413203219753
1033,So a vary wide array of interests,0,0.13457995866975905
1034,And I'm here today because well I was uh told it would be a good time here with the behavior study,0,0.1768600974688769
1035,Oh what year were you?,0,0.15445987288440202
1036,Okay,0,0.2387154408523499
1037,Okay so I'd say one fairly informal instance actually was over this last spring break,0,0.1388294277505842
1038,A couple friends and I four of us actually so a fairly small group um we biked from Philadelphia to Boston over spring break because we thought that would be a good idea,0,0.2582154915572636
1039,What it actually was huh there were some amazing ups some amazing downs,0,0.08904394198198064
1040,umm Definitely a very memorable experience,0,0.39245568688584626
1041,And there were just some points over the course of the trip when it was 45 degrees except your biking on the state highways it's raining and like ??? so we felt like giving up a little bit just heading back up taking the train,0,0.35991343842711376
1042,And I really riled people up in terms of reminding us why we were doing this and reminding us of the fact that we were already 60% of the way through we might as well push on all the way to the end of our journey,0,0.057803487703000624
1043,Just like I guess evoking everyone's different motivation because everyone you know wants to do something awesome but everyone has a slightly different motivation for why they join a team in the first place,1,0.6712110669180035
1044,And I guess providing like individualized reasons and individualized motivations to uh you know different parts of our team as to why they came on in the first place and why that's still something that resonates with them,0,0.43722042557844615
1045,And using that you know I was able to get the group back together and we did bike all the way back up here,0,0.17706877029180262
1046,So that was a very rewarding experience,0,0.13457995866975905
1047,Sorry a what challenge?,1,0.5803657338044622
1048,Oh oh another challenge,0,0.2387154408523499
1049,Okay,0,0.2387154408523499
1050,Um well let's see most of the challenges I've seen coming in any sort of team work right involve either internal challenges something that's coming from within the team or an external challenge,0,0.4716025486650735
1051,So I guess if we were to talk about an external challenge umm something not involving you know lack of motivation uhh it would uh let's see,0,0.13540441482744145
1052,So uh so my my freshman year I was involved uh I was involved in this organization called tech fair where we basically organized a um a tech expo at the beginning of the uh beginning of the school year,0,0.25353811833686407
1053,And I was again I was I was able to motivate people towards the end when there was a lot of work happening a lot of twelve-hour days to get the logistics down before the event,0,0.1768600974688769
1054,And I guess again there it uh it does come down to really motivating people um and speaking to their individual you know passions to get them to you know do things which they might not want to and short cut,0,0.07481686775896748
1055,Um my greatest weakness I've noticed can be a uh lack of lack of focus,0,0.2704138274778955
1056,Especially if I have like a large number of tasks it's very easy to instead of you know caching away all my other tasks somewhere and focusing on one at a time,1,0.5380555749984539
1057,It's very easy for me to you know pop one but still have you know like subtasks and the other things I have to do running in my mind,1,0.5380555749984539
1058,Um so of late I've been trying to basically get more organized,0,0.3022838906250506
1059,I've you know had this hypothesis that by using a Google calendar Google this Google that all these other products to try you know serve as fairly intelligent places where I can hash away my uh my other tasks,1,0.7559305009313493
1060,It will provide me with something which is very trustworthy that I will trust enough to not what worry about those tasks,0,0.2704138274778955
1061,Because what usually happens right I just write it down on a piece of paper,0,0.4339979105079576
1062,Um I don't trust that I'll be able to find and the risk of forgetting to do something important is is pretty great to bear,0,0.2704138274778955
1063,So that that's been pretty useful so far,0,0.13457995866975905
1064,I've noticed that I've had an urge sometimes to think about other things I have to do but I just remind myself that wait wait you wrote that down there,0,0.26575028774729503
1065,You probably knew what you were doing so don't worry about that,0,0.09500287980771166
1066,There's a supervisor which is yourself taking care of your other tasks,0,0.2903869332990904
1067,So I think that one thing um I do retain in addition to well like like I said I've had what used to be a problem in terms of being able to focus on a task but it does come with the added benefit of being able to juggle lots of tasks at the same time,0,0.1352367738043197
1068,I know lots of people who do focus on one task it often becomes one task one project going on for you know a couple months uh becomes the forefront of their thought their imagination becomes what they can handle,1,0.5211058519037516
1069,However having been accustomed to juggling lots of stuff in the past I think one great skill I can bring to the table is umm provide a very very agile agile member to the team who can juggle lots of different projects and bring insight to all of them without with my newfound organizational abilities getting too uhh too caught up in the mix,1,0.6100299707868481
1070,Thank you very much for uhh talking to me,1,0.9723827022850665
1071,Good How are you doing?,1,0.8452898993011722
1072,Uhh So my name is Skylar Shieto I'm a junior currently here at MIT,0,0.3022838906250506
1073,I'm studying course 18 mathematics uhmm currently enjoying it alot uhmm classes I'm currently taking not so much,1,0.6490718829987913
1074,Uhmm I don't know Is there anything in particular you want to know?,0,0.3611869277514505
1075,Ok,0,0.2387154408523499
1076,Ok,0,0.2387154408523499
1077,Uhmm ok so I was over at Ip I did book reports,0,0.4730831849790573
1078,Uhmm I kind of assumed like a project mangerish role particularly because I wasn't really familiar with Python too much which is the coding language that they used to test,0,0.34651595146154224
1079,Uhmm so I assumed more of a director kind of doing the math for it and kind of instructing people to do the mathematical thinking for that kind of thing,0,0.4316075683376617
1080,Uhmm Let me see I usually take this particular example,0,0.3572911640991484
1081,One of the tough things is you having to explain things that are sort of something that is very familiar to you to someone who doesn't have familiarity with that and especially in a really short time,0,0.22225047449424434
1082,Uhh can be extremely difficult,0,0.11521478613197428
1083,Uhmm It's how to deal with that,0,0.2387154408523499
1084,Uhh sort of just by giving a crash course uhm kind of asking other friends to also help so it's uhmm kind of give some information and ask for feedback that sort of thing,0,0.11521478613197428
1085,ok uhh let's see one of my weaknesses uhhm technical writing uhmm and what I'm doing to overcome that,0,0.15248303418968046
1086,Actually not very much I'm taking a math writing class,0,0.12805425526188313
1087,Uh so that's been really helpful,0,0.17963402645220658
1088,It's in a subject that I really enjoy and I actually have a paper due this Friday so hopefully I show so improvement and that would help,0,0.06788794010145202
1089,Uhmm not particularly,0,0.2387154408523499
1090,Sorry,1,0.5803657338044622
1091,Uhmm soo I would like a job which is sort of very open uhmm sort of open in a sense that it's open to new ideas open to uhmm the ability to uh work on different stuff,0,0.4716025486650735
1092,Sort of like whatever you want,0,0.45741044182905144
1093,Uhm Also in like a sense that you can go in and wear whatever you want you don't have to wear a suit and tie everyday uhm yeah,0,0.45741044182905144
1094,uh wouldn't be too bad,0,0.11521478613197428
1095,(laughs),0,0.2387154408523499
1096,I think this is also the sort of place where I can do things that are in my interest uhmm like statistics or computer science,1,0.7642480901805394
1097,Those sort of things,0,0.2387154408523499
1098,I'm doing well,1,0.5724056014340263
1099,Uh I'm a student I study computer science,0,0.3022838906250506
1100,Uh I'm in my last year so when I graduate in May I'm going to be working on computer science stuff,0,0.3572911640991484
1101,I demonstrate leadership on the track team I was senior pole vaulter on the team so uh right now were doing uh the conditioning and stuff like that and all through the preseason a lot freshmen come and its important to get them up to speed so the uh seniors on the team myself included uh lead them though the workouts and stuff like that and its important to be able to,0,0.3080838209192851
1102,to stand up and let them know how the tradition is and stuff like that,0,0.39245568688584626
1103,Hm,0,0.2387154408523499
1104,in my living group we uh we had a problem that the rent was getting too expensive because we didn’t have quite enough people living there but we still had a set amount of rent we had to pay as a group,0,0.4291592311319982
1105,So the prices were going up to the point that people had to get kicked out,0,0.024949938481925327
1106,So that was pretty rough but this happened like a year ago,0,0.060661407047331486
1107,So like one of my close friends was like I cant afford these prices like there's just no way,0,0.1768600974688769
1108,And like then it dominoes which was a huge problem,0,0.060661407047331486
1109,And a lot of people suggested a lot of different,0,0.11684632517741134
1110,a lot of different solutions,0,0.2387154408523499
1111,Most of them were like motivated from anger,0,0.2115156921086478
1112,So uh some people were like everybody who moves out should have to pay and other people were like oh no if I'm if not living there I shouldn’t have to do anything so so it was like pretty contentious,0,0.10272802370478028
1113,But but we worked it out to a,0,0.19732153176187164
1114,it was like a variation of a plan that I suggested which was that we would uh we would change the rent based on room size and how many people were living in the room,1,0.7120528119563496
1115,So we'd allow people to have more space themselves and pay more but people who would have otherwise been forced out could uh could have other people crammed into a room and saved a lot of money,0,0.1066093052570166
1116,So so we kept some of the people we kicked out,0,0.1066093052570166
1117,Yeah but it was pretty rough to get that motion passed,0,0.2115156921086478
1118,Uh I'm the opposite of type A so I can be pretty disorganized,0,0.08191717026182452
1119,My lab notebooks like a lot of the time I make a lot of scribbles in at and when I write code the documentation like tends to be on the shaky side,0,0.43441758665660263
1120,Um so so it makes it kinda hard for other people to follow when doing ? I never really thought it was a problem though until the most recent project that I've been on that I had to leave uh the project for a short amount of time and my partner like picked up where I left off and had no idea what was going on and I was like this is actually a problem the teachers like don't just tell you to document just to aggravate you,0,0.3732504393774121
1121,So I worked uh so like since then like I've been working on like documenting what I do just like more diligently but also to check back up on it,0,0.1768600974688769
1122,So that like there’s some kind of like review before like I show other people or before I let it out to a point that other people might rely on it,0,0.21611320583280333
1123,So just to like read my documentation that and which I've never done before until this most recent project had that problem,0,0.08191717026182452
1124,Yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
1125,Sure yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
1126,Mostly because uh results,0,0.2869118389241647
1127,I'm I just like get things done,1,0.6490718829987913
1128,And there’s a like there's a lot of things I know how to do especially the job I'm thinking of is like a programming job like a startup,0,0.27356360199342006
1129,My background my degree is actually nuclear engineering,0,0.23333067621579343
1130,SO so like I don't have like the background the internships the stuff like that,0,0.1768600974688769
1131,A lot of the coding interview questions they tend to ask I don't know which is pretty rough but uh I I think that I would be I should be hired because I would be resourceful and I'd do what it takes to get things done which is like working longer being more resourceful and stuff like that,0,0.3937983692193587
1132,So like I I feel like I could get more results then somebody who has the same or somebody who has a better background,0,0.27356360199342006
1133,So my name is Fernando Iber I am a junior here I come from Puerto Rico and I am currently studying biological engineering,0,0.09444753853762607
1134,Uh I’m considering doing pre-medicine maybe going into either an MD and let’s say apply to some schools as an MD or go into an MD-PHD program,0,0.3572911640991484
1135,Um my main interest is basically oncology but like I over the past few years I’m doing a couple of research programs I did an internship and it basically like gave me a view that I could tackle that problem in a lot of ways,0,0.08191717026182452
1136,So not just being a clinician but being a researcher a medical researcher,0,0.07018898356424853
1137,So that’s how I got interested into the whole MD-PHD thing and like I’ve gotten a hold of some programs that I viewed and there’s a lot out there,0,0.1768600974688769
1138,I couldn’t have imagined that if I stayed home,0,0.4730831849790573
1139,It’s amazing what people do here,0,0.39245568688584626
1140,So I’m I’m pretty involved in in campus groups,0,0.1768600974688769
1141,Uh I was the first founder of of their restructuring of Beta Theta Pi so I’m currently you would say chapter president,1,0.5380555749984539
1142,Uh so I’m leading the whole the whole cavalry of recruitment right here on campus and we’re getting a lot of results,1,0.5852163666581659
1143,Um I’m also in the Board of Puerto Rican students I serve as social chair and I am also pretty involved in dorm government especially rec-CBW planning so I just like to get around,0,0.21611320583280333
1144,So any anything that gives me that type of opportunity to just explore any guise is all pretty good for me,0,0.13457995866975905
1145,Uh I was also considering something for soccer uh in terms of being team treasurer but unfortunately I had a bit of an accident with my leg so I got out of soccer,0,0.04151446662050083
1146,So I actually have a really humbling experience,0,0.03414728906078335
1147,Last semester I took a class about mechanics,0,0.3022838906250506
1148,A lot of people in that class were juniors and I was a sophomore,0,0.3022838906250506
1149,So everybody there was much more experienced than me so I was the only sophomore in my group there were two ones that were juniors and it was the final project,0,0.09444753853762607
1150,And when we sat down and started talking about things to do I basically had almost no knowledge of the things they were planning ‘cause they already took cell biology and they took really advanced courses in fluid dynamics and they were trying to do some tissue modeling,0,0.12871674455088036
1151,Like even though it was a class about mechanics and I could understand some of the things I had absolutely no idea what I was doing,0,0.4716025486650735
1152,And they just put me there and one of them was really helpful and actually guided me through the initial process but the other one was not available at all at any time,0,0.05007391579932511
1153,So I basically had to sit down I actually met with the professor a couple of times just to like talk and chat and we took the professor out for for a lunch so we could just like talk about stuff and I actually had to find out my own way through everything with a little help of the only junior friend that was actually available to me,0,0.1032468558164049
1154,And it was humbling because normally when I worked on teams we were all pretty equal equal minded or it was in a humanities class,0,0.25353811833686407
1155,‘Cause normally technical classes here don’t have much to do with team projects in sophomore year,0,0.2387154408523499
1156,Normally laboratories and final design project classes are for older students so it was a surprise for me where it came like I’m a sophomore and I’m already doing final presentations for bio-mechanics,0,0.4716025486650735
1157,And it just caught me pretty off guard,0,0.13457995866975905
1158,And the only way…we ended up doing an extremely awesome project but it took lots of coffee Red Bull and Wikipedia,0,0.19732153176187164
1159,That’s my strategy for now ‘cause it was completely new territory right there compared to humanities or any other classes where you’re everybody has the same mindset,1,0.5380555749984539
1160,So that was my group trauma,0,0.04151446662050083
1161,So I didn’t have any actually trouble self-recognizing trouble about so stemming off of from the inexperience type of situation that was actually the first group project I had where that experience happened and I feel like if I get into something that I don’t basically know I have a really hard time finding stuff out for myself,0,0.05034229212330959
1162,So if I don’t come prepared to do something it takes me a while to get to a pace to actually start absorbing material and actually contributing which is kind of a handicap because some students are already up to speed and they already expect some things from me,0,0.03414728906078335
1163,And I I I obviously would like to give them my all and hand out everything they want on a silver platter but it’s hard for me,0,0.1560515835866549
1164,So I’ve been trying so basically like the solution for me was basically studying more putting much more effort from my part but it’s still a big a big minus in my in my turf,0,0.1768600974688769
1165,It’s uh it takes me a while to dominate things that that I don’t have an up-to-speed inclination to that,0,0.4716025486650735
1166,And that has caused like mishaps that well through hard work you can overcome them but a lot of work compared to your regular person,0,0.07772698000874113
1167,Yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
1168,So I feel like even though I’ve gone through many obstacles I’ve always tried and found a way to excel exert myself to bigger than I’d previously thought,0,0.27356360199342006
1169,So I might sometimes feel that I don’t have that knowledge on me but I will go out and get it even if it takes a lot of coffee or a lot of effort because there’s also a sense of satisfaction in actually giving it more than you can but seeing that actually succeed,0,0.14280139447180404
1170,You know what I mean? It’s uh it’s like what MIT does to you you’re humbled by an immense amount of work you’re humbled by by extremely hard classes that you had no idea that they were going to come and blast you with pieces homework and exams that you are overwhelmed,0,0.18887961033704553
1171,But you sit down you think about stuff,0,0.14724051066147714
1172,I sit down and I think about stuff and I get a plan there,0,0.2747457688513499
1173,That the good thing about the plan it takes some time to devise a plan because it it’s not as efficient it’s not efficient to go randomly guessing what to do but but having like an educated guess you remember the SAT’s where it’s like “you may not always know the answer but you can make an educated guess as to what the answer may be,0,0.3099658513946637
1174,” So that’s how I approach things when I have no idea what I’m doing but after some effort it will actually get me to a place where I can say “hey I’m here let’s get crackin’,0,0.12805425526188313
1175,” Um that’s sort of like the general mindset I have for many problems be it the life sciences you have to do an essay if I have to come up with elucidating a mechanism that does this to breast cancer cells or if I go by the walks of life can take you anywhere if I end up being a consultant for a for Johnson and Johnson let's say a company for random purposes and it's the same way you tackle every problem,0,0.3260083851308101
1176,You get up and you find out what you have a hard time doing then you sit down and do it,0,0.07562510044038717
1177,Uh sometimes it's frustrating because results don't come out like this um but I feel like once you get the hang of it you can start your productivity increases by x-fold x be a number much higher than one let's talk MIT here,0,0.4588075285625812
1178,Yeah I feel that's the that's at least my way of tackling things and it's gotten me through a lot and it's actually helped me wear down the walls of MIT and have a better experience at it so I feel it's the same way I should attack all the problems that come to me,0,0.05034229212330959
1179,Myself um I'm a junior majoring in computer science at MIT I'm very interested in product design and not just how products are designed but how the business side of it how they affect the users and how he can use the technology to affect the masses,0,0.4730831849790573
1180,I want to pursue (?) everyone,0,0.3938730607112474
1181,A time when I demonstrated leadership was um I was programs chair of the MIT Minority Business Association and it was my responsibility to plan our annual New York City Trip,0,0.4064865837293959
1182,And um some of the challenges were bringing in sponsors and delegating tasks to all the members and managing people essentially,0,0.08830690875445948
1183,And by um by delegating tasks according to interest and making sure that understanding people what was going on in people's lives and helping them understand why we were able to complete a task on time we were able to have a successful trip,0,0.19732153176187164
1184,Um a time when I was working on a team was in my Elemental Sulfur? Construction class and I faced not people problems but a technical problem,0,0.15248303418968046
1185,And it was a project in which we were trying to implement and the way we solved it was just by brainstorming and making sure we didn't deny anyone's idea off the bat we just tried to be as creative as we could be,0,0.0926304816353907
1186,And then we presented some of our solutions to a TA and through that we were able to solve the technical problem,0,0.04721556736134647
1187,One of my weaknesses is actually I learned from my internship last summer is that usually when I work on a project or have an idea I wait until the idea is fully fleshed out or partially implemented before I share with others and get their opinion,0,0.1388294277505842
1188,But it's I find it's a better and more agile approach to share ideas as soon as possible and to integrate as quickly as possible,0,0.21611320583280333
1189,So fail fast essentially,0,0.07652237551739818
1190,That what I would do to accomplish this in the future to seek opinion early on when I have an idea working on a project,0,0.28490738476045885
1191,Why I think you should hire me,0,0.3066981146350159
1192,I think you should hire me because I'm very I have a strong willingness to learn and I go beyond that and try to really get into why things are the way they are and why they work,1,0.5891649519555802
1193,I break it down to small steps and try to build it back up to similar success,0,0.35729155202333646
1194,myself umm I don’t know how much you know from any sort of registration or anything I am Young,1,0.5395318149680698
1195,I am Junior right now,1,0.5724056014340263
1196,I am in my third year,0,0.4730831849790573
1197,I am I guess I talk about what I am majoring umm I am majoring in mathematics and physics,1,0.6114423030620092
1198,I am also doubling in core six computer science,0,0.3938730607112474
1199,and umm I think I am getting minor in French and French literature,0,0.15455013832531528
1200,grew up in the states in northern virginia,0,0.2387154408523499
1201,Growing up I guess I was interested in I played a lot of competitive chess,1,0.6100299707868481
1202,I was also interested in recreationally tennis and soccer,0,0.3938730607112474
1203,and um other forms of,0,0.07018898356424853
1204,umm at high school I was at my junior and senior years I was captain of umm chess team of my high school and umm we participated in something,0,0.4064865837293959
1205,people thinks of chess as an individual sport,0,0.2387154408523499
1206,but umm we participated in quite a few team events,0,0.13278584963937465
1207,through the states which means one every year,0,0.2387154408523499
1208,which we have been winning every year every year,1,0.5052336361306978
1209,umm and also at the nationals,0,0.2387154408523499
1210,and before I went there they were little bit out of leadership,0,0.09444753853762607
1211,They used to get may be fifth or so,0,0.2869118389241647
1212,but when I was there I was umm managed to lead us to almost the first,0,0.30353397813348454
1213,We came in second in three years in a row,0,0.33141366362000685
1214,We came first in blitz which is speed chess,0,0.33141366362000685
1215,under my leadership,0,0.3022838906250506
1216,and to be fair the people coming in were talented to begin with,0,0.13457995866975905
1217,but perhaps had they not had that environment wouldn’t have done as well,0,0.16634557565434505
1218,challenge umm there are countless examples when umm in group projects in high school,0,0.2387154408523499
1219,umm there was one time when umm freshman year in high school,0,0.2387154408523499
1220,We were working on a umm we had something we called ibet integrated biology electronics and umm biology english technology we had a group project,1,0.5052336361306978
1221,Four persons in the group,0,0.2387154408523499
1222,and a few days before the presentation we found the person who had done a decent bit of data analysis had done it incorrectly,0,0.0926304816353907
1223,and he was not available,0,0.13457995866975905
1224,he was out of town at the time,0,0.2387154408523499
1225,again we didn’t fully know what had gone wrong but he had come up with some results which were clearly umm could not be explained by experimental error,0,0.2977831921157918
1226,clearly he had done something incorrectly,0,0.2115156921086478
1227,So we had rush to fix what had gone wrong and to redo many of the tests which was a big challenge given the time constraint,0,0.04721556736134647
1228,We had to redivision the work in addition to what each of the remaining members had to do anyway and compile the final presentation,1,0.5052336361306978
1229,of course it’s not a life threatening challenge,0,0.11521478613197428
1230,weaknesses umm I guess one weakness would be being very honest with myself in terms of trying to determine what I want to do and focusing all my faculty on that,0,0.3937983692193587
1231,Rather than keeping ones options open which I think a good thing,1,0.6100299707868481
1232,but I think umm sometimes it can be an excuse for not taking risks,0,0.0705571610152508
1233,this is important because where I went to high school,0,0.4716025486650735
1234,The culture was very pervasive of trying to do everything and in great part it causes you not to commit to any one thing,0,0.25930501603055445
1235,which in one way could be good in terms of keeping your options open,0,0.45741044182905144
1236,but on the other hand if you knew if you had known what you want to do specifically and devoted all your resources to that specifically of course you could do better than that,0,0.16870585012516354
1237,and in the end you probably go to pick something,0,0.11222070821856067
1238,I think one weakness is to be honest with myself about what specifically I want to do and devote resources to that,1,0.5737824960575687
1239,umm what I am trying to do to address that,0,0.1620597888134149
1240,it may seem at the beginning umm somewhat paradoxical,0,0.14316569343261962
1241,but what I’ve been doing is trying out wide variety of things so I can’t use the excuse,0,0.03830508073008954
1242,there are bunch of things I don’t know yet,0,0.3022838906250506
1243,I’ll keep my options open,0,0.4730831849790573
1244,I’ll try them out and if I don’t like them I’ll drop,1,0.6490718829987913
1245,that’s a way to decide what’s left to do that I’d like,1,0.5724056014340263
1246,alright so it’s still early in terms of job search but one job that I would like that I am considering is trading umm trading or some sort of quantitative finance,0,0.4716025486650735
1247,and umm I think I’d be a strong candidate because I have an extremely strong quantitative background in mathematics and modeling umm computer science work I’ve done physics as well,0,0.27356360199342006
1248,and umm I have history of being competitive both in academic environment and in chess and in other sports,0,0.1768600974688769
1249,I have always known,0,0.3938730607112474
1250,especially if we the role we are talking about a trader trading I have always been interested in strategy games such as chess poker etc,0,0.4064865837293959
1251,trying to find an optimal strategy and use it to win the game,0,0.39245568688584626
1252,and that I think the kind of skillset that is necessary for this kind of job,0,0.15455013832531528
1253,Fine,0,0.39245568688584626
1254,Uh I’m Daniel,0,0.3022838906250506
1255,I’m a Freshman,0,0.3938730607112474
1256,I’m from uh Fort Lauderdale Florida,0,0.3938730607112474
1257,Thinking about course AN61 here,0,0.2869118389241647
1258,I uh actually uh I was here for running but I realized it wasn’t me so um I decided to drop early and am pursuing travelon,0,0.06826483070942177
1259,So um yeah classes I am doing fine,0,0.1768600974688769
1260,Looking for a job now,0,0.2387154408523499
1261,That’s about it,0,0.2387154408523499
1262,Uh I’d say probably I’d say rowing in high school was probably my best demonstration,1,0.5338463461786015
1263,I was um senior in my in the junior varsity boat after some little qualms with sea-re-sing? I’d really like thought it showed them that like even though I wasn’t put in the best situation like I performed indiscriminately,0,0.3133450648821134
1264,And I think in a way I showed them that we would still be able to compete against a varsity eight and there was times where like we were always even like half the season we were always like around the same time,0,0.3731609464718653
1265,And we ended up uh medaling at states,0,0.1066093052570166
1266,And I’d say that um a good part of that is by leading by example by the older um upper classmen so I feel like maybe that was the point where I was demonstrating leadership,0,0.11320191250810435
1267,Well there was a lot of issues with my coach in in rowing,0,0.2704138274778955
1268,So um if it wasn’t I think um I went through a lot of issues like that with my assistant coach at came for a year and she helped me sort things a lot,0,0.1352367738043197
1269,She showed that I did have um proper technique,0,0.4716025486650735
1270,It was more of like like a discriminating issue of my coach wanting certain people on the boat just because he thought it would move better,0,0.3937983692193587
1271,I realized that um as long as I kept on pursuing the sport like that’s all that really mattered,0,0.38535842737456816
1272,That’s all like my own efforts will fruit in something that will take me somewhere that will help me get into MIT,0,0.4716025486650735
1273,So I feel like um this this like seeing things in my own way right and being distraught by other people effecting me helped,0,0.1352367738043197
1274,I think one of my weaknesses has to be um the fact that I’m a little um delinquent with my work,1,0.5737824960575687
1275,And uh um I’m lazy at times,0,0.04151446662050083
1276,I definitely procrastinate,0,0.21250816544335416
1277,It was a pursuing thing through high school,0,0.2387154408523499
1278,And uh it’s still a little now because of a passing record,0,0.07018898356424853
1279,One of my combating is goal setting,0,0.3022838906250506
1280,I learned it from one of my uh from one of these one of an upperclassmen that I know in uh at MIT,0,0.4730831849790573
1281,He uh told me like to write out like weekly goals and write out long term goals,0,0.39245568688584626
1282,Like long terms goals meaning like the end of MIT after MIT what you want to do after the MIT experience and short term goals which is like get stuff done now,0,0.45741044182905144
1283,So in a way that kind of put me things put things in perspective for me,0,0.07018898356424853
1284,Realize that I shouldn’t be burning too much time messing around,0,0.18755857915192653
1285,By I mean certainly I should be messing around a little bit just because it’s it’s a good time to have fun and relax,0,0.32230062042973917
1286,But at the same time I shouldn’t do it in excess,0,0.118032441819917
1287,So I guess that’s helped me a little bit,0,0.27356360199342006
1288,Um actually yeah um,0,0.09607975816263775
1289,I’ve never had lab experience before so I really want a role which is why-,0,0.23333067621579343
1290,Uh well for starters um I don’t have any experience so I feel like um it’s a good place for me to start,1,0.6100299707868481
1291,And I’m really willing to do whatever it takes to make time for it,0,0.06788794010145202
1292,Um I see how um I’m not taking too many classes this semester cuz I’m a course advantage,0,0.4716025486650735
1293,I’ll be making sure I’ll have enough time to make classes uh more manageable,1,0.6490718829987913
1294,I should be able to commit hours on it,0,0.45468571979582034
1295,I’m really interested in the job I’m doing so hopefully that interest will inspire me uh inspire me to work hard,0,0.20657798909957484
1296,Um well I was born in Nigeria,0,0.4716025486650735
1297,Um and I moved to the United States at the age of eight um and lived here um in Boston actually ever since,0,0.12805425526188313
1298,Um and um for as long as I remember umm I've always wanted to go into the medical field,0,0.3022838906250506
1299,Umm I've always wanted to be a doctor and just recently actually discovered that I wanted to be a pediatrician umm after working with kids and doing a lot of babysitting in high school and have actually umm shadowed a neonatologist and I feel like that was when it clicked that I actually really want to be a pediatrician,0,0.34651595146154224
1300,Umm and I've tutored a lot umm middle school and high school and that's really like affirmed the fact that I do like my career,0,0.23226963873358347
1301,I want it to be something where I work with kids,1,0.6490718829987913
1302,A time I've demonstrated leadership,0,0.3022838906250506
1303,Umm I guess one obvious one is the student groups that I work with,1,0.6100299707868481
1304,Umm my primary umm student group is the black students union,0,0.3022838906250506
1305,I'm currently a coach here,0,0.3938730607112474
1306,Umm and I've been active with the group since I've been at MIT,0,0.3022838906250506
1307,Umm currently as a coach here I plan all events for umm the group umm as well as kind of represent the group umm in front of administration as far as like what our members want what they need umm if they have any concerns or anything like that,0,0.3694476305055536
1308,And we have several meetings with administration on a regular basis just to communicate what's going on what we're doing and what our membership needs and what how they can help us with that,0,0.1066093052570166
1309,Team,0,0.2387154408523499
1310,faced a challenge,0,0.2387154408523499
1311,Umm,0,0.2387154408523499
1312,Okay umm I guess back to the student group,0,0.4316075683376617
1313,Umm so this is the second time I've actually been on the executive board,0,0.12805425526188313
1314,Umm the first umm last year the executive board ran really smoothly,0,0.17963402645220658
1315,We worked well together but this year we,1,0.5052336361306978
1316,we're kind of having problems 'cause it's a new set of people so it's kind of hard adjusting umm to the people I'm working with,0,0.06408131848943939
1317,Umm so you know we all have different viewpoints different ways of approaching things,0,0.3927973489599513
1318,Umm so we had a lot of loss of communication which kind of hindered umm our uh progress this year umm but in the past few weeks we've been able to kind of figure out that you know there's been a loss of communication and we should definitely like you know we need to figure out how to stop that barrier and learn more to communicate more in order to get the things that we want accomplished done,0,0.415240651165385
1319,My weaknesses,0,0.21250816544335416
1320,umm,0,0.2387154408523499
1321,I think my biggest weakness is not knowing when to say no,0,0.39521743774958146
1322,I'm the kind of person that if someone asks me to do something even if I feel like it's impossible I always say yes,1,0.5737824960575687
1323,Umm and I've always,0,0.3022838906250506
1324,I think I realized that problem when I came at MIT and I've been working on that ever since my sophomore year umm and I'm a junior right now,1,0.5737824960575687
1325,Umm and what I've been doing to overcome it is kind of schedule myself,0,0.3022838906250506
1326,Umm I have my calendar,0,0.3022838906250506
1327,I live by my calendar and I know if it doesn't fit on my calendar if it's overlapping with something then absolutely no I can't do it,0,0.4730831849790573
1328,So I live by my calendar now and it's definitely helping me say no to things when people ask me to do things for them,0,0.1768600974688769
1329,[laughs] Umm,0,0.2387154408523499
1330,I think that I am a good asset,1,0.7642480901805394
1331,Umm one because MIT experience has definitely prepared me for I would say the worst umm because of the experience as an MIT student,0,0.15248303418968046
1332,So it's a unique experience umm but I've also umm gained a lot of umm a broad range of academic skills umm not just in in the life sciences but also in engineering field and political science field umm that I think I can bring into the medical field umm with the help of the knowledge that I gain in medical school to kind of help the world which is want I want to do ultimately,0,0.27356360199342006
1333,So I think umm I would be a good asset for the medical field,0,0.27356360199342006
1334,Umm so I'm a junior at MIT i'm a math major umm i have experience in both the economic side of thing's and uhh cs simple coding umm interested in going into probably analytic's or trading in the future,1,0.5353244206591785
1335,Umm so I'm involved in the undergraduate study of Women in Math and one of the most recent activities we've been doing involves kind of an outreach project umm for middle school and high school girl's where we can bring them together and have them all do a collaborative math event as opposed to normal competition math so i kind of experimented in the project to umm do that,0,0.14153925129016182
1336,It was originally aimed for just ya know local umm Boston girl's so we did all the publicizing for that I mean I know get it a lot more publicity than we expected people in from like California and stuff so,1,0.7451478071734184
1337,Yup,0,0.2387154408523499
1338,Okay umm so I guess I'm also a member of China Development Initiative and so a lot of times umm when were in events most of them are within our own group so were brainstorming for like service leadership programs and stuff like that,0,0.3731609464718653
1339,But umm we also try to do some events where we bring in professors and other speakers,0,0.1066093052570166
1340,So some of the big challenges we face include umm actually finding these speakers getting them to really correspond with us,0,0.03887770666152822
1341,Like sometimes they'll respond and be like oh were interested but then they just don't follow up so going after them kinda looking for that response,0,0.16634557565434505
1342,okay umm I would say I'm generally more of a passive person when someone gives me a task I'll do it I won't really like if i get stuck I'll kind of try to keep working on it myself instead of asking for help,0,0.1388294277505842
1343,Umm so I've been trying to umm i guess talk to more higher ups if i run into issues or ask more questions i guess,0,0.2397396965153384
1344,Umm we being?,0,0.33141366362000685
1345,Okay,0,0.2387154408523499
1346,Umm I think i would bring a lot to the team in terms of umm teamwork in addition to the qualifications i have academically speaking umm I guess i would say that I have a lot of experience working with teams umm a lot of experience in the analytic side of thing's as well umm as well as a pretty interdisciplinary background in general,1,0.7642480901805394
1347,So i would be able to bring a lot more umm i guess umm directions to the team,0,0.2747457688513499
1348,Um well my name's Ann,0,0.4716025486650735
1349,I'm currently a Junior in [??] Biology,0,0.3938730607112474
1350,I'm originally from San Francisco,0,0.3938730607112474
1351,Um I am interested in going to medical school,0,0.3022838906250506
1352,And I didn't really come to this decision until like around Au- August or September of this year,0,0.08546649212793798
1353,I was deciding like I mean I always had it like in the back of my mind,1,0.6490718829987913
1354,'cuz my dad is a doctor,0,0.3022838906250506
1355,Um but and I knew coming into college I wanted to study Biology,0,0.3022838906250506
1356,I wasn't sure if I wanted to do um like research or um medical school,1,0.6490718829987913
1357,So um I had a year off or I still have a year off,0,0.09444753853762607
1358,And of course [??] and I really liked it,0,0.06788794010145202
1359,But I felt like research is something uh you have to be like self driven,0,0.32951325534129816
1360,to do,0,0.2387154408523499
1361,And I kept getting like frustrated because a lot of my experiments they wouldn't work and I felt really bad,0,0.05034229212330959
1362,[??] And then uh I also like volunteer at a hospital just to like gain experience and see what it's like,0,0.1768600974688769
1363,And uh I enjoy helping people,0,0.1768600974688769
1364,So I think decided for sure now [??] school,0,0.15455013832531528
1365,Um I guess leadership can be like defined in a lot of ways I guess,1,0.6100299707868481
1366,One of my main activities that I've been doing at [??] is um working in a student group called ESP or the Educational Studies Program,0,0.3022838906250506
1367,And um so I teach an AP biology class on the weekends to the high school students in the area,0,0.09444753853762607
1368,And I guess that's kind of like being a leader because you have to like stay in control of the class and organize everything,0,0.32951325534129816
1369,Um I guess um the experience that's like most like strongest in my mind is actually from high school,0,0.34651595146154224
1370,So I used to be on uh my high school's robotics team,0,0.09444753853762607
1371,And uh none of us really like knew much about engineering or like building robots when we first started,0,0.07692020109018043
1372,So it required a lot of like teamwork and working together,0,0.13457995866975905
1373,Um I remember communication was one of our main issues because we would divide into sub-teams and then each sub-team would like work on a part of the robot,0,0.3694476305055536
1374,But then sometimes we forgot to like communicate clearly with each other and then that result in major problems down the road,0,0.11581967354018562
1375,So,0,0.07018898356424853
1376,Um so I guess for us it was like a spe- special situation because um um we were all like my friends and I were all sophomores,1,0.7120528119563496
1377,And then there were no upperclassmen above us,0,0.1066093052570166
1378,on our robotics team,0,0.33141366362000685
1379,So our like very first years that we were the leaders of our team we really struggled because we didn't we had no like prior experience,0,0.033447486732009805
1380,in how to organize a team,0,0.12279001203990068
1381,So like after our first year like our sophomore year together we like like had a like a sit down discussion afterwards,0,0.19732153176187164
1382,and like talked about what went wrong like what could've been better,0,0.060661407047331486
1383,So the next year we we have like uh we implemented like uh daily meetings,0,0.19732153176187164
1384,So like before we would like split up for the day and like work on our uh work on our robot,0,0.0926304816353907
1385,We would like outline a plan and then like show it to everyone,1,0.5052336361306978
1386,and like discuss with everyone,0,0.13457995866975905
1387,So that really helped,0,0.05007391579932511
1388,they discuss,0,0.2387154408523499
1389,Um one of my weaknesses is I'm really shy,0,0.057481900992564096
1390,Like I think when I was younger I go- I didn't like to like talk to strangers,1,0.6100299707868481
1391,or talk in in front of a large group of people,0,0.07018898356424853
1392,So um when I came to college I thought that uh I should try to improve that,0,0.27356360199342006
1393,So um I think the main thing I tried to do was the teaching activity I talked about before,0,0.15455013832531528
1394,Um requires me to you know stand in front of a group of high school students and talk for like three hours at a time,0,0.45741044182905144
1395,So I think uh I'm becoming a lot more comfortable like talking in front of people I don't really know that well,0,0.11320191250810435
1396,Um I think I have like the passion to help people,1,0.6100299707868481
1397,Um I I had a lot of like volunteer activities but I really enjoy helping people especially like um children,0,0.23226963873358347
1398,So I used to I used to tutor like young children at the Cambridge Community Center and teach them how to read,0,0.1768600974688769
1399,Um and I'm currently doing the like tutoring I mean not tutoring the AP [??] teaching,0,0.4716025486650735
1400,You know um so I'm like motivated to help people,0,0.30054073244304513
1401,Um and I think that like as especially as the world becomes like bigger or the population gets greater more and more people like will need medical help,1,0.6100299707868481
1402,So I think being a doctor would be a good good way to help people,0,0.27356360199342006
1403,I'm doing very well thanks,1,0.9824285457861849
1404,How are you?,0,0.15445987288440202
1405,I'm currently a junior pursuing a degree in both computer science and business and what's really drawn me to both of these is the fact that they involve a lot of problem solving and a lot of interpersonal dynamics,0,0.08380780208344905
1406,A lot of interesting questions come up where it’s a lot of actually thinking innovatively and that’s why I’ve chose to major in both of these and actually that’s why I’m interesting in consulting is because it’s a good application of the problem solving that I’m doing in both of those,0,0.1388294277505842
1407,Umm recently I was in a group project where each of us kind of had our own task to do and it was a very straightforward class project however umm these was I noticed a lack of communication a lack of set deadlines so umm in that case I kind of stepped up,0,0.3694476305055536
1408,I organized communication between all of us,1,0.5067186044464734
1409,I really got us on the same page and pushed us to a strict deadline and you know it’s a good thing I started when I did because otherwise we would have missed the deadline,0,0.34943787492196404
1410,Umm I’ve also had a lot of leadership positions if you want something a little bit more structured,0,0.3611869277514505
1411,Okay,0,0.2387154408523499
1412,Umm last semester I was an event director for my sorority and what I had to do for that the biggest event especially logistically fell under my responsibilities so I with a $2 200 budget organized a dinner event for 200 people at restaurants across Boston so this involved umm finding places making all food allergies were taken care of really finding out what everyone in my sorority needed and wanted with their evening and this also involved a lot of delegation because you know there were about 20 restaurants involved and I couldn’t personally be in charge of all of those so I had to delegate out to a committee make sure that they knew what was happening manage the risk aspect of it by keeping track of who had left who hadn’t gone as yet everyone knew their reservations how to get there how to get back,0,0.018800164199575694
1413,So in that case it was kind of a different style of leadership with more of delegation and things like that,0,0.13457995866975905
1414,Umm let me see,0,0.2387154408523499
1415,I guess the first thing that comes to mind is that same item I was just talking about where we weren’t all on the same page and not communicating,1,0.7132693244092474
1416,Umm so I guess in one of my classes last year we had a team project where certain elements of it were things that none of three of us on the team knew how to do or were particularly interested in learning how umm and the way we kind of resolved that issue because clearly as an aspect it needed to get done we resolved that by making sure the person who took that had less responsibilities elsewhere to kind of balance it out,1,0.5066404005866445
1417,So the girl who took that was happy because her main priority was spending less time whereas for the rest of us we were more interested in the actual material so we found a mutually agreeable solution,0,0.19732153176187164
1418,Yes,0,0.2387154408523499
1419,Umm I think one of my weaknesses is that I tend to get very excited about everything I’m doing you know that like I’m a double major because I started in computer science and then I went oh management really excites me too I want to do that as well which in the past has led me to kind of overextend myself a little bit which as a result when you’re really excited about everything but then you try to do everything the amount of commitment you give to each one is reducing but I’m conscious of this year,0,0.06470480981479461
1420,I cut down a little bit on my extracurriculars and…especially because last year while doing all of those I wasn’t sleeping as much which you know while I was still there and pulling my share and everything you know it was harder to be a full present member of anything if you’re tired,0,0.3273150694050083
1421,So this year I kind of focused in on the things that were most important to me and I’m aware of that so when I feel myself reaching my limit I’ll actually try to prioritize more,0,0.05034229212330959
1422,As I mentioned before what I’m studying in school is very applicable to consulting but in addition to that I’m really excited about the work that consultants do especially as I mentioned I’m very interested in a wide range of fields and with you consulting you really get to explore a lot of those delve into them and in consulting I’d get to apply my favorite aspects of computer science and management both which is again the problem solving the thinking innovatively,0,0.1738164489300764
1423,These are all things that are very important to a consulting company and that is exactly what I love to do so I think I would have that passion and drive that makes every member of your company that I’ve spoken to really engaging and it seems from all of my previous conversations with them that they’re really excited about this which is you know exactly what I would hope to bring as well,0,0.14280139447180404
1424,Good,1,0.9036480987850044
1425,I'm a junior at MIT studying Ocean Engineering,0,0.3938730607112474
1426,And I'm really interested in working with big ships,0,0.03414728906078335
1427,I love being on boats and by the water,1,0.5724056014340263
1428,I am on the sailing team,0,0.3938730607112474
1429,I spent the summer building underwater robots,0,0.3938730607112474
1430,Um this last year um I restarted the section of the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers at MIT,0,0.3022838906250506
1431,We had one about five years ago when Ocean Engineering was Course 13 but now it's merged with the Mechanical Engineering Department and when that happened the organization fell apart,0,0.17070910373751436
1432,But I knew that me and some of the other Ocean Engineers wanted to really have our own society,0,0.05293056977477877
1433,So I started it and I went to this meeting to how to get it all setup and got a professor to sponsor us,0,0.14153925129016182
1434,Mmhmm,0,0.2387154408523499
1435,This last January I was working with my team in robotics team,0,0.3022838906250506
1436,And we there was a big conflict in the team because we thought we were going to build a six foot long glider which is pretty huge,0,0.15177057591599707
1437,The parts are so large and so heavy we couldn't machine anything ourselves we had to get it all done in a machine shop externally,0,0.33141366362000685
1438,But we had to have a glider that size to like accomplish the goals for the glider which were look for oil,0,0.19732153176187164
1439,Um so like but then were were also working on a smaller version of the glider that didn't have all the sensors we needed but otherwise had the same capabilities,1,0.5052336361306978
1440,And it was more easier and more fun because we could machine everything,0,0.19732153176187164
1441,And um it was easier to understand the small piece,0,0.13457995866975905
1442,But there was an awkward moment in January when half the team was working on the big glider and half the team was working on the small glider and we didn't know if we wanted to trash the big glider and work on the small one,0,0.0926304816353907
1443,And so I was part of the team that decided that we should focus on the small glider,0,0.17461607110769672
1444,So we took the design from the big glider and took as much as we could to put on the small glider and assigned people to work on the small glider,0,0.19732153176187164
1445,One of my weaknesses is I think being aware of the energy that I bring into a room,0,0.2397396965153384
1446,So when I am at meetings I really try to put positive energy into the room,0,0.06788794010145202
1447,Even if one day I'm really feeling quiet I make an effort to say things or make an effort to react to say things,0,0.23226963873358347
1448,Haha,0,0.2387154408523499
1449,You should hire me because um I can bring good energy to a team and engineering experience especially related to the ocean and ships related to the ocean and underwater vehicles,0,0.35539237345894487
1450,And I have experience working on teams,0,0.09444753853762607
1451,Great [laughs] tired,1,0.795698102512541
1452,Um alright I go to MIT course ten and seven,0,0.3022838906250506
1453,Um I want to be a doctor,0,0.3022838906250506
1454,I'm an EMT,0,0.3938730607112474
1455,What else is there? A little sister,0,0.12279001203990068
1456,Hmm I grew up here in Florida but I was born in Toronto,0,0.3022838906250506
1457,Uh yeah [laughs],0,0.2387154408523499
1458,Um probably when I worked as an EMT,1,0.5338463461786015
1459,You know you're there to support your colleagues,0,0.2886839945882999
1460,And you know people have to trust you if there're going to want to call you,0,0.16870585012516354
1461,And that's the whole of this service is that we want people to trust us and you know taking on the extra work load and working 'cus I'm an MIT student and you know taking nightshifts or working in between classes and,0,0.3071236897231417
1462,Pretty great responsibility so,0,0.39245568688584626
1463,Um I rode for six years so you know it's obviously a team requirement so,0,0.3611869277514505
1464,Basically every time you show up to a race that's a challenge right? And I have a quote that hangs on my wall and it's training is the opposite of hoping,0,0.10429856273872934
1465,So it's just working really hard to sort of prepare for you know trying to achieve your goal,0,0.013677923384974415
1466,Because I think all the training you know that's how you make your own fate or preparing you know preparing for a test whatever,0,0.497733547164182
1467,And to work for it you know things don't come very easy so,0,0.16870585012516354
1468,I am a huge perfectionist,0,0.3938730607112474
1469,So you know you [inaudible] into trivial things that you know you know I shouldn't waste so much time perfecting and I- I will so,0,0.13066361956026723
1470,That's- that's probably the worst thing,0,0.14316569343261962
1471,My boyfriend tells me all the time he's like You have to stop expecting everything to be perfect I'm like I know so,1,0.7070690685863894
1472,Uh just trying to like put things in perspective I guess so,1,0.6100299707868481
1473,Definitely became harder to do at MIT,0,0.2387154408523499
1474,You know you can't be perfect because you know everyone here essentially is so,0,0.34243106980647703
1475,Everyone's very good at doing stuff so,0,0.13457995866975905
1476,Um I mean because I work really hard,0,0.11161482957460721
1477,I love it,1,0.5724056014340263
1478,I don't see myself doing anything else with my life,0,0.4730831849790573
1479,It's weird [inaudible] Why are you doing that? I don't know you know I thought it was this thing but,0,0.4602829865210856
1480,I don't see myself you know sitting in a cubicle or behind a computer being like a code monkey,1,0.7070690685863894
1481,Um I need a career I'm up on my feet and,0,0.3022838906250506
1482,I love interacting with people,1,0.5724056014340263
1483,I love the science behind medicine,1,0.5724056014340263
1484,And um you know being able to change someone's life,0,0.08967900877249617
1485,I know it's probably a pretty cliched answer but it's the only thing that like I can see myself doing,0,0.1917622658599578
1486,You know adding productively into society so,0,0.2372142273492121
1487,I’m doing good,1,0.5724056014340263
1488,How are you?Thank you,0,0.15445987288440202
1489,Well um my name is Jeff um,0,0.4716025486650735
1490,I was born in Japan,0,0.3938730607112474
1491,I lived there for seven years before I moved to the uh US,1,0.5866576737975321
1492,First to Michigan for two years and then to Maryland,0,0.2387154408523499
1493,Um and it was when I was in high school or I’m sorry middle school that I was exposed to um a lot of different math uh science advanced science courses,1,0.7974282575990507
1494,Um it was where um I was exposed to a lot of um math competitions and computer science competitions,0,0.3022838906250506
1495,And it was around my uh junior year in high school,0,0.118032441819917
1496,It was around my junior year in school because of peer and parental pressures I decided to do pre-med,0,0.3572911640991484
1497,I decided to pursue uh a career in medicine,0,0.3938730607112474
1498,Um so it was in high school that I decided start taking biology classes physics physiology and um when I got here to MIT I decided to major in Course 20,0,0.3022838906250506
1499,Um and after about four lab positions two of the (inaudible) and two of chemistry that I realized um the Course 20 the medicine track wasn’t for me,0,0.15248303418968046
1500,Um mainly because it wasn’t quantitative enough or competitive enough or fast paced enough for me,0,0.45321313756248316
1501,But with my last internship in the biotech industry I had the privilege of talking to talk with several site directors,0,0.1768600974688769
1502,Um it was because of and through that meeting I realized that I might really like finance and that it might be more suitable for me,0,0.2796426796551633
1503,Um and afterwards I started talking to some colleagues,0,0.3022838906250506
1504,Um some finance majors,0,0.2387154408523499
1505,And that’s why I’m here,0,0.09444753853762607
1506,Um I would say it was during high school,0,0.3022838906250506
1507,There was this one group sophomore year,0,0.2387154408523499
1508,We had to do this mission this project called Mission Impossible where we had to design a rover that would uh traverse a uh a uh platform with quantum data,0,0.17070910373751436
1509,The problem with the group was there was supposed to be a leader but nobody really took an responsibility to do what they had to do,0,0.05360237764535133
1510,That was partly due to the fact that nobody really individuals were assigned anything,0,0.09607975816263775
1511,So that was when I had to I decided to take the initiative a couple of days before it was due,0,0.09444753853762607
1512,Actually with the whole project to uh become the leader,0,0.09607975816263775
1513,The unofficial itself leader,0,0.2387154408523499
1514,As a leader I uh assigned a tasks to people,0,0.3022838906250506
1515,Politely I asked them to do this because this was a very um (coughs) multi- prospective project that um,0,0.3022838906250506
1516,It required programming construction and educating,0,0.2387154408523499
1517,And yeah I decided to be leader and assign tasks,0,0.09444753853762607
1518,And I would say it was pretty successful the robot got in time it was due,0,0.1768600974688769
1519,Ok well I would like to talk about my past at my most recent internship at a biotech company,0,0.4716025486650735
1520,Um and the problem was that I was working as an individual group,0,0.15248303418968046
1521,It was because I was working with cells,0,0.3022838906250506
1522,And cells the way cells work is that um that you culture them like on say day 1,0,0.16870585012516354
1523,And you let them grow like four or five or six and then you let them grow until you collect data,0,0.16870585012516354
1524,And the problem is you’re not even can’t collect the data on day one you have to collect on day six,0,0.03930246502748748
1525,And if anything happens on day 3 or day four or something or sometime between day one and day five the data will make no sense,0,0.07018898356424853
1526,You would have to re-start the experiment,0,0.13115931029929018
1527,And I was on a tight schedule and this was a ten week project,0,0.09444753853762607
1528,And in the first two weeks I contaminated the cells,0,0.04151446662050083
1529,Um both weeks um,0,0.2387154408523499
1530,And so my data had to be re-done my experiment had to be re-done,0,0.09444753853762607
1531,The problem was that this was a ten week project and I had eight weeks to do,0,0.15248303418968046
1532,One thing I learned about internships is to not panic when situations like such as this arise,0,0.2704138274778955
1533,And uh what I did was I went to people for help,0,0.09444753853762607
1534,Um and I definitely spent more hours,0,0.3022838906250506
1535,I talked to the HR department I talked to my managers to increase my hours from 40 to 60 hours,0,0.4730831849790573
1536,Uh so instead I went Saturdays and Sundays too,0,0.3022838906250506
1537,In fact there was this one point where I worked 23 days in a row um,0,0.23226963873358347
1538,And uh successfully I think finished it,0,0.27356360199342006
1539,In fact after my data analysis and data compiling uh I presented my data to the site director,0,0.12805425526188313
1540,He told me I had the most impressive presentation out of all the 21 other interns there,0,0.4716025486650735
1541,Um So Yeah it was during challenges like that because of challenges like that that I’ve learned to not panic in a stressful situation and to definitely branch out for help,0,0.2704138274778955
1542,I think one of my weaknesses is that I don’t have a formal education in finance,0,0.39521743774958146
1543,Um I decided to be Course 20 and um uh and I decided to pursue pre-med,0,0.3022838906250506
1544,And I was I agree uh that it was a very sudden transition to math Course 18,0,0.09444753853762607
1545,I think make up for that at least partially by uh going to workshops uh going to reading books um,1,0.532476616497347
1546,I definitely have been networking with colleagues,0,0.3938730607112474
1547,So in terms of the financial models uh the mental math skills and the preliminary skills that I mean to I believe I have a very strong grasp of those,0,0.1768600974688769
1548,Well I think um that compared to the rest of the competition no one shows more initiative than I do,1,0.6100299707868481
1549,And in fact I don’t anyone has the technical skills or the willingness to work such long hours,0,0.06788794010145202
1550,Um I think one of my strengths is that I don’t have any problems with high expectations because I had to do such a sudden transition in career,0,0.2397396965153384
1551,I had to do a lot research to convince myself that I won’t have to do this transition again,0,0.4730831849790573
1552,Like I said I’ve networked I’ve done tons of research I’ve read books I’ve done tons and tons of research,0,0.4716025486650735
1553,And you know out to site directors you know even out to first year analysts,0,0.08967900877249617
1554,And I know exactly what my job is,0,0.09444753853762607
1555,And I know that the long hours are tough and anyone else who says they like the long hours would be lying to you,0,0.10429856273872934
1556,And I know the exact skill sets required and I believe I have those skill sets,0,0.1768600974688769
1557,Thank you,1,0.9723827022850665
1558,Thank you for this opportunity,1,0.9723827022850665
1559,So umm I'm from Chicago,0,0.09444753853762607
1560,and I'm a junior here at MIT umm when I came here I was pretty sure I wanted to do health related work so I guess I came in as a biology major,0,0.27356360199342006
1561,And my dad is also a MDHP really interested - or really involved in research,0,0.03414728906078335
1562,Um and so sort of that influenced me a lot,0,0.2387154408523499
1563,So then I realized after doing biology for two years essentially that I wasn't really enjoying it (laughs),0,0.08546649212793798
1564,And so I decided to try out computer science,0,0.09444753853762607
1565,Because this is MIT after all and if I did want to do biology in the future which it's not that I don't like biology it's that I didn't feel like I was learning skills that would contribute to the field I guess,1,0.6100299707868481
1566,And so um yeah,0,0.07018898356424853
1567,So then I decided to do computer science,0,0.09444753853762607
1568,That's a very small part of me (laughs),0,0.2387154408523499
1569,That's a very broad question,0,0.2387154408523499
1570,Um so I am the co-president of an organization at MIT called Glo-Met and what we do is we're partnered with a non-profit gratitude organization abroad so our group is basically non profit,1,0.5852163666581659
1571,We work with HIV health care work in Togo and so I guess an example of leadership would be this whole semester I suppose it's been a work in progress it's the first time I've ever been like in a president's role in a group of about 30 people,1,0.7120528119563496
1572,And all the records are new this year its a new organization,0,0.07018898356424853
1573,So it's sort of like realizing you know there's so many aspects of leadership it's not just like not only the objectives your group needs to get done but also the camaraderie you have in a group and we can show that's being maintained properly,0,0.2428917736095061
1574,Um and we had a lot of really troublesome leadership experiences last year with this group,0,0.0652265562111153
1575,Um so I guess I've been learning a lot,0,0.4316075683376617
1576,Do you have specific questions about that?,0,0.2903869332990904
1577,Okay,0,0.2387154408523499
1578,So yea in terms of like leading a group of people that are like you know my age umm and we're all like new at it it's definitely a work in progress,0,0.3071236897231417
1579,But we do a number of things in terms of umm we fund raise for,0,0.1066093052570166
1580,so we hold campaigns and we fund raise in order to basically fund our projects abroad in Togo so we are trying,0,0.1066093052570166
1581,our main project right now is to improve the technological efficiencies of the clinic that we're partnered with in Togo so we,0,0.19732153176187164
1582,it's hard sometimes motivating a group of people when your partner is abroad it's not like we haven't met them yet and it's a new partnership so we're traveling there this summer but since it's new its kind of as a leader I think it takes a lot of like not only vision and fore planning but like also like you have to be able to step back and allow other leaders in your group to step up,0,0.2439282069851289
1583,You can't just do everything yourself,0,0.16458277299120885
1584,Even if that seems easier,1,0.5309974197500003
1585,Umm and then also like maintaining the motivation among a group of people that are like really busy with other things in their lives,0,0.17963402645220658
1586,So that's the biggest challenge I think but,0,0.15455013832531528
1587,Umm,0,0.2387154408523499
1588,so I guess the same organization we had a lot of umm problems,0,0.10714651126468565
1589,Um so we are a team as an organization,0,0.33141366362000685
1590,So last year I was like a director on the exec board but not umm one of the co-presidents and the biggest challenge we've had as a team was that our co presidents were not motivated had very poor communication and we didn't have we just didn't really get anything done,0,0.04563071281870011
1591,Umm so a challenge on my part was not really I wasn't sure I knew what needed to get done and I knew things like we needed to be more efficient and take more initiative and you know motivate our staff because it's not like it's not just about us we obviously there are people that like depend on us,0,0.3842912264835878
1592,and umm the problem was like not stepping on their toes at the same time while trying to,0,0.060661407047331486
1593,trying to get them motivated but you know telling and I think a challenge was that they felt it was they felt personally attacked when people criticize them,0,0.16949659631330274
1594,Or when people try to make suggestions for better things to do umm so I think solving that problem was more just stepping back and being like you can't do everything if that person is the president you just have to let them do what they're gonna do and wait til your ends do your job right but don't try to push like you can't always push through things sometimes you gotta just like go,0,0.16949659631330274
1595,And like,0,0.13457995866975905
1596,and I guess that's,0,0.15455013832531528
1597,that did kind of solve the problem,0,0.11521478613197428
1598,I mean I didn't solve the problem of like things not getting done,0,0.43441758665660263
1599,But like I think realizing that actually helps a lot,0,0.11320191250810435
1600,Because it was just like banging your head against the wall,0,0.45741044182905144
1601,So,0,0.07018898356424853
1602,yeah! (Laughs),0,0.2387154408523499
1603,That's like also a weakness I guess,0,0.3937983692193587
1604,I guess a weakness of mine would be that I am pretty umm,1,0.5737824960575687
1605,Knowing how to step back and not umm,0,0.12279001203990068
1606,basically not trying to do everything myself when it's definitely supposed to be a team effort and that involves a lot of like trust in other people and their competency,1,0.5338463461786015
1607,So umm,0,0.07018898356424853
1608,definitely giving people the chance to do the job right,0,0.39245568688584626
1609,And sometimes you make second chances,0,0.11222070821856067
1610,So I think that's,0,0.15455013832531528
1611,I might have a bad temper sometimes,0,0.2572009881343378
1612,That can be part of it (laughs),0,0.2387154408523499
1613,So yeah,0,0.07018898356424853
1614,I think because I'm very motivated,1,0.7642480901805394
1615,And I have a lot of self initiative and I'm hard on myself so that sometimes I expect highly of other people in the same way and that can I mean that is part of both the challenge and the weakness question that you've asked about but I think that is umm good in when you have a team of people and like you need somebody that umm is very meticulous about delegating things properly and making sure things are done at the right time,0,0.16949659631330274
1616,And somebody who really takes like self responsibility for things,0,0.05007391579932511
1617,So,0,0.07018898356424853
1618,I think if it's for like a project for example like a small group project its like good to have someone that isn't shy to speak up in a group,1,0.7011590230711708
1619,And somebody that can sort of like organize the group to to coordinate the group better,0,0.13457995866975905
1620,Like vocally,0,0.39245568688584626
1621,(Laughs),0,0.2387154408523499
1622,I am in aerospace and engineering and a,0,0.3938730607112474
1623,well with ROTC you get a lot of,0,0.45741044182905144
1624,ah in unified last year uhm we had the,0,0.33141366362000685
1625,One of my big weaknesses would be ah,0,0.15248303418968046
1626,well ROTC is kinda forcing me into,0,0.39245568688584626
1627,(slight laugh),0,0.2387154408523499
1628,ah because I'm physically qualified and,0,0.4716025486650735
1629,Mmm hmmm,0,0.2387154408523499
1630,I’m good,1,0.5724056014340263
1631,How are you?,0,0.15445987288440202
1632,Umm So my name is Juliann ok uhh just hold up so what what exactly would this interview?,0,0.3022838906250506
1633,Ok,0,0.2387154408523499
1634,Ok,0,0.2387154408523499
1635,So I’m Juliann I go to MIT I’m currently a junior I’m hoping to attend your the medical school that I’m applying to,0,0.22001190438092705
1636,Umm yeah I’m studying computer science and biology which is a pretty new umm course here at MIT and currently I’m taking mostly biology classes I’m also doing research in the hematology lab and umm yeah so a little bit about myself umm I guess if you want to know a little bit about my background before college I was born in Tai… I was born in California… in Irvine umm and my parents and I moved back to Taiwan when I was about 10 so I went to International school there umm but yeah most of my friends were pretty bilingual,0,0.32951325534129816
1637,They spoke both English and Chinese so I would say that I’m pretty you know fluent at both languages,1,0.5380555749984539
1638,And yeah really look to both California and Taiwan as my homes,0,0.03414728906078335
1639,Ok umm let’s see… So I as I said I’m from Taiwan and I’m I’m part of a student group here at MIT called the association of Taiwanese students and what I actually was was a cultural chair uh for a year and one of our main events is to create a night market so umm yeah so instead of you know the outdoors night markets that you see in cities in Asia uhh we actually took it inside into our student center so we had to work with umm the leadership from a bunch of different other clubs so this included like the Chinese students club umm the association of sorry the Asian American Association as well some other umm cultural clubs in order to create this event and so what my partner and I were in charge of was the food and what we thought we thought that this was you know one of the umm biggest points of the event in the first place so umm yeah I think that you know ha… getting everyone umm as a group to really sit down and look at you know how much money we had to allocate here and how much umm you know time everybody needed to set up umm and we yeah so my partner and I were in charge of that and I thought that that was one time where we really showed our leadership and made something umm you know arise out of that,1,0.7064918277021595
1640,A team umm lets see ok so over the summer umm I actually this last summer before my junior year umm I went to Taiwan and China,0,0.23333067621579343
1641,Taiwan and Hong Kong specifically to teach…,0,0.2387154408523499
1642,And this was in groups of three so there were two other MIT students and I umm teaching in a group…,0,0.09444753853762607
1643,And so what this conflict arose umm where we had two weeks of umm teaching and we weren’t sure because there were there was also another group another group of three teaching at the same time and we weren’t sure if the students really wanted us to like switch classes so that they could get umm more more time with all of the six instructors umm or if we just wanted to stick with the same grup of students for a complete two weeks…,0,0.033447486732009805
1644,And so you know kind of a conflict arose out of that umm it was pretty much you know three versus three like three of us wanted we thought that it would be a good idea to switch and umm the other three thought that you know they wanted to have a more personal relationship with their students,0,0.18930204381703078
1645,And umm yeah eventually what you know we we sat down at first it was pretty heated umm like so two of uhh my colleagues like one person from my team and someone from the other umm had you know really strong strong ideas about umm what they wanted to do,0,0.13062676423831393
1646,So you know what I said was hey everybody like let’s sit down and calm down and you know think this through and talk it through and you know I I felt like I was one of the mediators in that you know I didn’t let myself get you know too involved at first and I didn’t let you know start screaming or anything like that and I was really the one that said hey everybody sit down umm let’s talk this through and so we really just you know calmly and logically thought it through talked it through and you know we were like oh what would be the advantages of of switching and what would be the disadvantages? And in the end we felt like umm the students were there to get breath and not necessarily depth Since it was only two weeks anyway and so we felt like it would be a lot better for them to umm have more exposure to all of the MIT instructors from all different backgrounds,0,0.0985811586277544
1647,Ok,0,0.2387154408523499
1648,I feel like one of my greatest weaknesses is uhh self confidence,1,0.5737824960575687
1649,I you know I’m not naturally somebody who really wants to take a center stage to everything,0,0.28427183694764935
1650,Umm and you know there are people like some of my friends are very much so people who are in the center of attention a lot,1,0.5380555749984539
1651,And I think that that’s something that I have been working on and will strive to work on umm in the future as well,0,0.27356360199342006
1652,Well I think that you know I (laughs) I I’ve demonstrated a lot of umm I have a lot of experience in the medical field umm as a college student umm I do research in as I said in the hematology lab and I actually also work as an EMT,1,0.5891649519555802
1653,So that’s been a very very large big part of my life since umm last January,0,0.09444753853762607
1654,Umm when I got my EMT EMS umm license and yeah so I actually work here at MIT umm as a Emergency Medical Technician Uhh I work probably 15 hours a week on that,0,0.037359185527432524
1655,Umm but moreso beyond my experience I really have a passion for the medical field,0,0.23226963873358347
1656,Umm and I you know want to see help both the research that I do that you know hopefully in the future uhh some clinical the clinical work that I do will effect medical field,1,0.5380555749984539
1657,Pretty good how are you?,0,0.45741044182905144
1658,All right,0,0.39245568688584626
1659,Um I guess to start with the basics I'm uh a junior at MIT right now,1,0.6100299707868481
1660,I'm studying course six three it's computer science,0,0.3938730607112474
1661,And uh I guess I didn't really get into computer science until last year,0,0.058349808998298384
1662,And um that's after I transferred here from the University of Michigan,0,0.09444753853762607
1663,And then uh since then pretty much everything I do has been computer science,0,0.1768600974688769
1664,Yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
1665,All right um so this past um this past summer um I uh got well I guess last year I got involved with an organization on campus called Camp Kasim,1,0.6100299707868481
1666,And so Camp Kasim runs a camp for the children of cancer patients,0,0.030395260313939607
1667,And it's um it's kind of a therapeutic camp so the aim is for kids to just have fun,0,0.13457995866975905
1668,And anyway we have various units that we break the kids up into to that are divided up by age,0,0.04721556736134647
1669,And um I wasn't the unit leader for my unit but uh there was a time when our unit leader had to go off and uh it was either his break or he had to uh go off and take care of some other stuff,0,0.06408131848943939
1670,And so uh I was kind of given control of the unit,0,0.09444753853762607
1671,And so um it was an interesting experience because we were dealing with kids,0,0.19732153176187164
1672,But um obviously the counselors were adults and college students my peers,0,0.09444753853762607
1673,All right um so in I guess the last time I can really remember being part of uh really intense team experience was um in high school I was on the year book as a photographer,0,0.1804648747309403
1674,So um we I my friend and I were both the head photographers,0,0.14153925129016182
1675,So we organized all the photos,0,0.1066093052570166
1676,And so we would coordinate with the editors,0,0.1066093052570166
1677,And um in that they would tell us what sort of content we needed like what events needed to have photos taken of them or what teams needed photos,0,0.19732153176187164
1678,And we would go about organizing the actual um like the sending of the photographers to go to these events or to get the team photos,0,0.19732153176187164
1679,And so um there we times when like just getting making sure that our photographers got to events uh and like and end up getting a decent amount of good photos um was could be very challenging,0,0.0926304816353907
1680,Because I mean because we were all very busy students,0,0.4064865837293959
1681,And so um one like just I guess one challenge we faced was just getting people to like really commit to their job and follow through on that,0,0.1679107013538831
1682,And so part of what we did was just try to build a really strong like team culture,0,0.07692020109018043
1683,And a sense of like comradery among the photographers themselves,0,0.13457995866975905
1684,Um you know try to get people to um like try to get people to go to event even though and they weren't assigned,0,0.45741044182905144
1685,Just out of like the eagerness to take photos and photography,0,0.39245568688584626
1686,And so um we kind of approached this challenge and motivated it was like it was sort of a challenge in motivating our our um peers,0,0.19732153176187164
1687,And so um or like incentivizing these photos,0,0.13457995866975905
1688,And we approached by trying to like build a sense of community and uh like like and like and ambition in terms of like taking photos,0,0.19732153176187164
1689,Um it was it ended up playing out very well but there's still a couple photographers who just you know,0,0.16870585012516354
1690,They just didn't want to do the job sometimes,0,0.2869118389241647
1691,I mean they they usually had like valid some what valid excuses but,0,0.1465538958373867
1692,Yeah but yeah this job still need to get done,0,0.07018898356424853
1693,So uh yeah I mean that was uh pretty interesting team experience,0,0.1768600974688769
1694,Sure um yes,0,0.2387154408523499
1695,Let's see um maybe one of my I'd say one of my weaknesses is communicating my thoughts clearly,0,0.32230062042973917
1696,Uh at times I struggle to uh I struggle to quickly come up with a sentence or phrase to describe what I'm thinking,0,0.2397396965153384
1697,And so I like I find myself kind of slowly articulating a sentence,0,0.08191717026182452
1698,And um there's some situations were just like that those pauses and that slow thinking or slow articulation is uh can be problematic,0,0.07652237551739818
1699,And in other in other situations like the slow thinking ends up being some what useful because I've you know I don't say anything I don't tend to say anything rash,0,0.1299902880238
1700,And so um it has it's merits,0,0.07018898356424853
1701,But usually its just in general it's nicer just to have a faster pace so in kind of like conveying thoughts,0,0.16634557565434505
1702,Um um so I'd say that I'm committed hard working uh person,0,0.15248303418968046
1703,And in terms of this job I guess uh and my edge can I describe what it is?,0,0.15455013832531528
1704,All right so in my head it's a software engineering position and so I believe as um I can contribute a lot to this with the skills that I've gained here at uh MIT,0,0.4716025486650735
1705,And then also I believe that I can gain a lot from the company in terms of learning um about what they do and how they do it,0,0.1768600974688769
1706,And I think it would be a good partnership,0,0.27356360199342006
1707,So umm I was wandering umm I'm actually from Russia,0,0.06826483070942177
1708,I grew up in Tulun though and I normally go to Cambridge University-,0,0.4730831849790573
1709,-which is which is where I study,0,0.3022838906250506
1710,Here I am uhh a foreign exchange student uhh with MIT,0,0.3022838906250506
1711,Uhh I study course six umm mainly I focus my interest split them more like uhh between umm the afternoon where I focus more on devices look like nano electronics uhh processing methods umm circuits and also stuff that has to do with uhh I think it has to do with AI control machine loading umm so what I'm interested in,0,0.3937983692193587
1712,I've been taking courses to that uhh goal so things like 6034 6052 6017 umm in those same areas I've done several projects umm like something Cambridge over summer I did a I wrote a uhh simulator umm the simulator basically simulates a landing on Mars and has to take in account physics umm graphics planetary rotation umm and I have to write an AI which accounts for all that and is able to land and launch umm in a space craft,0,0.3080838209192851
1713,Umm similarly I've also been participating in a robotics uhh competition in Cambridge,0,0.3022838906250506
1714,Umm it was similar to MIT's Mass Lab umm and I was on the software team again uhh although I have done a little bit of electronics and the goal of that project was to in a team of six create a robot which is able to navigate a black uh sorry a white grid on a black table umm and be able to pick up a cylinder thing with a magnet or without a magnet based on whether uhh it was magnetic or not take it into a certain box and I programmed the uh AI for that,0,0.3150767045299086
1715,So that's the most experience I've had,0,0.09444753853762607
1716,Umm in Cambridge here uhh I've considered participating in uhh umm Battlecode or Mass Lab perhaps,0,0.3572911640991484
1717,Umm there's been some quite interesting projects going on umm in class; those should be quite interesting,0,0.45321313756248316
1718,Yeah yeah it was good pretty good,0,0.39245568688584626
1719,Umm so umm again in the robotics project uhh competition at Cambridge umm in in our team of six I had to in some ways help out and direct the design choices in our umm for the competition,0,0.4064865837293959
1720,Uhh some things include deciding which sensors to be placed and where and kind of the overall idea was basically because I am running the AI I have to umm have a clear idea of what the robot has to do what its components are and I was the one to be the go-to guy in case somebody had to make the decision up based on that,0,0.4716025486650735
1721,And I made decisions uhh just based on rationality where umm if something was the idea was that something has to be umm only as complicated as it needs to be and no more complicated because any more complications make problems stuff doesn't work breaks umm so yeah,0,0.08191717026182452
1722,And I also helped out with the electronics and sometimes the woodshure which umm sensors to hook up to which control lines and stuff like that and I had to blast them on umm well what I wanted to be done for the AI to work properly,0,0.10958394335366817
1723,Umm another case of leadership I guess was I did military service in Finland uh uhh as a citizen-,0,0.4316075683376617
1724,-and umm so we had this at the end of the service near to the end there was a umm a anti air camp where all the anti air regiments and battalions were coming together at this one big training camp and as a member of the communication squad umm we had to go and set up some things for the light fly exercises and because our sergeant was away doing some things umm I really didn't know what he was doing but I-I had to take charge of the squad and make sure that the cables were done right and had to delegate tasks to certain people that you know these two guys you know do this cable and these guys set up the radio I'll do this and so yeah it was quite alright I guess that way,0,0.3530626841194945
1725,Umm well with the with the six people uhh we split each ourselves in three teams three sub teams,0,0.2977831921157918
1726,One was mechanical one was electrical and one was uhh AI,0,0.2387154408523499
1727,Now because my programming experience was much bigger than the programming experience of the other guy on my team umm we said that it'd be better if he was to help out with the mechanics 'cause there was umm a lot of hand work to be done uhh a lot of design work there and the AI is easily written by me when umm I just kind of have a clear idea it was much faster then splitting with other people it was rather simple AI I guess,1,0.5066404005866445
1728,Umm now with the mechanics it's much more important they get all this stuff done leave some time in the workshop work so it was a decision we had to make umm to get more of that kind of get more of that hand work to the mechanical team more man power to the mechanical team,1,0.5052336361306978
1729,Uhh with the electrical team umm we decided that we wanted the meaning doing most of the design work for the electronics 'cause you get a better idea and they also gonna be doing most of the soldering of electronic parts 'cause so we got uhh some basic components we we got this controller block umm with with a CPU inside but it had to be wired to sensors and controllers and other controllers and all that so we had to do all those circuits,1,0.5713018750224388
1730,Umm so one of the guys Oscar umm was much more into that so he took charge into design and uhh Calvin did much more the soldering and stuff,0,0.2387154408523499
1731,I kind of helped out when they needed some help,1,0.5724056014340263
1732,Umm so yeah we just needed to have a clear delegation of tasks and just do a bit of try if somebody needs something done we'd be able to produce a kind of working-ish result-,0,0.19732153176187164
1733,-so that we could get stuff out,0,0.33141366362000685
1734,So as an example I-I made a control system which uhh follows the lines way before I wrote any of the code for picking up stuff or testing what it is and how to choose where it goes,0,0.09444753853762607
1735,The idea was that I am able to follow the line and turn umm which kind of tricky actually so the way the sensors set up and the motors weren't properly balanced and such,0,0.02935760559696661
1736,Umm so the mechanic guys managed to work together umm at a quick rate with just some of the basic plates they didn't they didn't cut them or anything,0,0.39245568688584626
1737,They just got a plate put some motors on uhh hooked up the motors into the CPU and did that and it worked,0,0.39245568688584626
1738,I was able to make the AI which follows the lines which was pretty good,1,0.5724056014340263
1739,Umm also that that that did mean that the umm the Oscar who made the sensor connectors umm he had to kind of work faster and make those particular circuits work before he made any other control circuits,0,0.39245568688584626
1740,But delegating those things that way it well will do a step by step and do it gradually,0,0.13457995866975905
1741,Umm I guess one of my weaknesses is that I often get carried away umm I guess somewhat arrogantly,0,0.2397396965153384
1742,Umm when I'm working with something and I think I have a really good idea of what I am doing umm something is better than other umm I have a better idea of wondering than therefore try to tell them maybe they're doing it slightly wrong be sort of somewhat more self-absorbed in what resources need to be allocated because I'm doing a lot of stuff and they might be doing it more slowly so I can use this for longer or something,0,0.05034229212330959
1743,Umm not not to the point of insulting people but more sort of center of attention kind thing I guess,0,0.09656964089283986
1744,Umm I'm trying to kind of be more mindful of what other people are doing and sometimes that even though I think I have an idea of what I'm doing I don't actually or that I might be mistaken,0,0.09656964089283986
1745,So I kind of try to be more kind of chilled and laid back just yeah so yeah but it's a work in progress,0,0.1768600974688769
1746,Umm well you should hire me because I am capable of uhh pretty good verbal communication umm I don't really stress out much I think so I'm quite relaxed that way,0,0.22322479893436015
1747,I'm able to speak three languages so I'm able to communicate quite well umm Norwich Finnish and English,1,0.7035513784479208
1748,Umm and I tend to be quite good at being able to delegate tasks to people so I'd be good for like a project lead I guess because I have a pretty good technical background and I understand the tech and I quite enjoy working with the tech and I also like being with a team environment where I can delegate tasks and work on umm different things,0,0.27356360199342006
1749,On on some things we can accomplish by ourselves on a larger project working on a team is quite fun if it works out right,1,0.5671518808090605
1750,Yeah pretty good,0,0.39245568688584626
1751,Um don't feel particularly different from any other day,0,0.2869118389241647
1752,Um so I'm from Nearbell Fosten [SP] Northern Ireland,0,0.3022838906250506
1753,I have three younger brothers um so I think they have kind of influenced me as much as I probably have influenced them,1,0.6114423030620092
1754,Like Mark the next one down he's only a year younger than me so he was always a lot sportier,0,0.39245568688584626
1755,Uh coming up through school he was always playing rugby and cricket and because of that I got into those sports,0,0.3022838906250506
1756,Um and then Ian the next one down after him is a lot more artsy and stuff so I think because of his influence I'm kind of a bit more appreciative of things that I would have maybe just kind of like disregarded before,0,0.27356360199342006
1757,Um Like um when we was down in New York there we went to MOMA and there was like um the Scream by Munch or Moonch,0,0.2977831921157918
1758,whatever which was there and some Van Gogh Starry Night and some lilies by Monet,0,0.2387154408523499
1759,So I [??] with that,0,0.09444753853762607
1760,But you know what? He will probably want to hear about this so I'll go and I'll take some photos for him,0,0.14868321799823644
1761,Um and then Harry is the youngest one he's kind of like just gets away with everything being the youngest,0,0.39245568688584626
1762,But um should be pretty good to go back around Christmas and catch it with them and stuff,0,0.16634557565434505
1763,Um probably not get back over to Cambridge in the UK over Christmas break but I try to keep in contact with friends from there through like Facebook and stuff,0,0.32230062042973917
1764,Um and yeah just really enjoying my time here at the moment,0,0.23226963873358347
1765,That's a little bit of background on me and my family,0,0.3022838906250506
1766,Uh so this I'm here on my third year what you call junior year my first two years in Cambridge I was part of like the Student Council for the college there while I was in college,1,0.5380555749984539
1767,So as part of that we do have like we call it Thrashers Week where as you kind of call it Freshman Rush dorm exploration or whatever um so we had a big kind of end to that week finale event that kind of took over college like multiple music stages and the legal drinking age in the UK is 18 so everyone at university could drink so there were different promotions on different um bars all over the place in the college different attractions and stuff,0,0.2428917736095061
1768,So um just kind of planning that deciding what the theme would be um how we were going to decorate up the colours to tie in with that and getting music acts um getting promotions on the main bar and just making sure we were covered health and safety wise in terms of enough canisters fire extinguisher points emergency plans and obviously working as part of a committee on that and being responsible for individual sections particularly [??] being responsible for a particular area I think that's quite a practical hands-on time when I've been given leadership and I think I done well with it,0,0.19821442239249298
1769,It was yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
1770,Right,0,0.39245568688584626
1771,So um again going thinking back to Cambridge in the UK um we one of the things that Cambridge is known quite well for is Rowing so I got to Cambridge and I was like ah I've never tried rowing before I'll take this up,0,0.30353397813348454
1772,So um in my first year there was me and a few of my friends took it up and we continued it into our second year but one of friends then decided he didn't have time for it and just kin- kinda dropped it to the wayside but we had the big kind of races that are towards the end of the summer there they're called the Maybumps [SP],0,0.14153925129016182
1773,And obviously any kind of sport team work is important but in rowing so much of it is just getting in time with each other working as one and it takes like the whole year to build up this,0,0.13457995866975905
1774,So him deciding to [??] was really going to be massively detrimental 'cause you can get someone to sub in and fill his seat but it's not the same,0,0.013677923384974415
1775,Um so convincing him to stay on as part of the team and kind of rallying like getting a good like boat spirit that we weren't just here guys that kind of rowed but we all got along well and we actually wanted to row for each other,0,0.2571389984462586
1776,And because I had been given responsibility as Boat Captain no like the overall boat club captain but that boat,0,0.1768600974688769
1777,So um doing things like havin' um pre-race meetings together and watching like video clips before like kind of motivation Rocky style stuff,0,0.060661407047331486
1778,Um and just making sure like we were training hard but people were enjoying training and it was the right kind of balance between yeah we need to train at this level to be good but we don't need to go absolutely overboard and we can gauge when people just need time off or need time to unwind or de-stress,0,0.0926304816353907
1779,Um so kind of implementing that and it came round to the actual Bumps races he hadn't quit and um we managed to do a lot better than the previous term previous term being a bit of a disaster then this term we actually the best boat from the college,0,0.12568037976852317
1780,So that was pretty satisfying,0,0.13457995866975905
1781,Um like again it just kind of shows like the races are painful and tough but you work together to get through them you feel good after,0,0.38026266453766394
1782,So that was like a pretty obvious sporting example of teamwork,0,0.13457995866975905
1783,Um I think overall I'm quite like confident and happy to talk to people and stuff but maybe a weakness could be that sometimes I do dive into things a little too eagerly like um it could almost be that I could become better at these kind of interviews by just having the that extra confidence to just sit there quietly for 20-30 seconds think what the question actually specifically asked and answer it rather than thinking okay they've stopped talking I better start and just diving in with an answer,0,0.09898247874719385
1784,And I'm coming across then as perhaps a bit frantic or not completely focused,0,0.052649740061650144
1785,So I think some of that is just going to be practice like do interviews get comfortable with sitting with a little bit of silence while I compose my thoughts and going into a well structured answer rather than just diving straight in with an answer as I've kind of been doing I think so far,0,0.27356360199342006
1786,Um I think that obviously to hire someone they need to have the qualifications that are gonna allow them to do well in the job but like almost any job um in today's world isn't going to be specifically tied down to one individuals sector,1,0.6100299707868481
1787,It's going to require skills that cross a variety of disciplines and I think that like I've used my university time so far in the UK and in America really broadening the experience that I've got,0,0.34651595146154224
1788,Uh broadening my uh ex- exposure to different fields of engineering,0,0.3022838906250506
1789,And also using the really quite amusing house program you have here to broaden my exposure to even like artsy stuff,0,0.10870280988648662
1790,Um I also think that through like projects lab work and things of that nature I have the skills to work in a team,1,0.6100299707868481
1791,Be that having the uh kind of humility to accept okay there's someone more experiences more knowledgeable than me in this I'll take the lead from them or I'll start realizing when it's an appropriate time I'll take the lead here because no one else is really going to or I'm the best qualified to really take command,0,0.23226963873358347
1792,So like in terms of working with others that's a strength that I have um and I think in terms of contributing to like the overall atmosphere in the company I'm quite a pleasant optimistic person,0,0.27356360199342006
1793,I like to think that I'm someone that others would be happy to work around so not only would I be working well but others would be working well um through my being there,1,0.7035513784479208
1794,Um I'm not saying like I'm going to suddenly make the company like 200% more profitable but I do think that I'll feedback in as much benefit as I'll get out of a job that I genuinely enjoy,0,0.27356360199342006
1795,OK,0,0.2387154408523499
1796,Thank you,1,0.9723827022850665
1797,I'm doing pretty good,1,0.5724056014340263
1798,How about you?,0,0.15445987288440202
1799,Yeah it's kinda shitty outside haha,0,0.2387154408523499
1800,Gotcha,0,0.2387154408523499
1801,Yeah I thought it was going to snow but I'll take like drizzle over that,0,0.27356360199342006
1802,Uhm,0,0.2387154408523499
1803,So I'm a junior obviously here at MIT,0,0.09444753853762607
1804,I'm studying chemical biological engineering and minoring in economics,0,0.3938730607112474
1805,Uhm I live in Cap Sigma which is one of the fraternities on campus,0,0.3022838906250506
1806,I'm from Chicago,0,0.3938730607112474
1807,Uhm actually I was just home recently for Thanksgiving,0,0.12805425526188313
1808,Uhm and then here on campus I obviously go to class and when I'm not in class I do the like getting involved in my fraternity as well as uhm I try to help with Habitat for Humanity so I do a lot with them and some community service stuff that we have as well,0,0.25353811833686407
1809,Oh cool,0,0.39245568688584626
1810,Where?,0,0.2387154408523499
1811,Okay I'm from Siokee,0,0.3022838906250506
1812,Uhm so if I had to give I guess an example of leadership,0,0.4316075683376617
1813,uhm,0,0.2387154408523499
1814,recently this semester I'd probably talk about uhm working with Habitat for Humanity like I mentioned before uhm I'm currently the president of the club and uhm so we do a couple of different things on campus here both on and off campus uhm related to like international organization and so one of the big things we do on campus is we uhm have what we call the Beaverdash,1,0.6441745759161528
1815,And its a 5k run around the West end of campus,0,0.08830690875445948
1816,And we've done it about 5 of them now,0,0.1066093052570166
1817,So this year has since I was in charge of the club I had to organize it uhm and it was kind of a unique situation because uhm,0,0.09444753853762607
1818,We were working with the President's office,0,0.33141366362000685
1819,Uh combining with President Griphes inauguration night,0,0.2387154408523499
1820,Actually they contacted me,0,0.09607975816263775
1821,Uh which was awesome because like they have a ton of money,0,0.39245568688584626
1822,And resources that I normally wouldn't have,0,0.09444753853762607
1823,So I uh was able to work with that,0,0.1768600974688769
1824,but I think it was a very interesting leadership posi- uh position because I was networking with my own execs which is 10 of my own students that I work with,0,0.27356360199342006
1825,As well as the greater club which is about 100 kids that actively participate,0,0.39245568688584626
1826,But then also in conjunction with the President's office which is a couple people in uh staff uhm,0,0.07018898356424853
1827,With like uh the Z center and things like that,0,0.39245568688584626
1828,So we were all working together to organize this larger than normal event in conjunction with other activities going on that weekend,0,0.1066093052570166
1829,So it definitely took like going to meetings with like staff and more important people in the world of MIT,0,0.13457995866975905
1830,And like relaying messages and working with like my own board and getting stuff done,0,0.1768600974688769
1831,And selling tickets and actually running the event and coordinating the volunteers and things like that,0,0.05007391579932511
1832,So I think it was a really good leadership opportunity and I worked with a lot of interesting people,0,0.11320191250810435
1833,Uhm lets think of a good challenge,1,0.5309974197500003
1834,Uhm,0,0.2387154408523499
1835,Okay so uhm more recently I was working on well I'm involved with my fraternity,0,0.4716025486650735
1836,One of my objectives was to plan a little retreated that we have like going camping,0,0.3694476305055536
1837,So as part of that I work with a team of people some of them are freshmen which is who the retreat is meant for,0,0.08191717026182452
1838,Some of the are my friend well everyone's my friend but so its like an interesting dynamic because you're working with your friends but you have to kinda be managing them and stuff like that,0,0.21899413203219753
1839,So that was like challenge number one,0,0.13457995866975905
1840,But then the real challenge was to coordinate essentially like we had 60 people and we wanted to go camping somewhere,0,0.23979299191356468
1841,The real challenge we had was getting people to commit and to count accurate numbers and stuff like that,1,0.5052336361306978
1842,So I was really able to like in the context of the team organize people to go and personally talk to like all 60 people,0,0.06788794010145202
1843,So we could get a feel for like who was actually coming,0,0.09659515268243245
1844,Because an issue we had in the past 50 people would say they wanted to come but only 40 people would show up,0,0.17070910373751436
1845,Those 10 people are actually like hundreds of dollars wasting,0,0.08335277541638189
1846,and so its really important to get an accurate count and finding out who has dietary restrictions who had certain,0,0.05007391579932511
1847,Traditionally it is really nice to use like email to talk to people but here we've been really utilizing uhm actually going in person and having meetings together and breaking out and talking to individuals and then like doing allocation of like who was going to call the various utilities whether it be car rental or food purchase or stuff like that,0,0.12568037976852317
1848,Uhm so there's a lot of different allocation of uh tasks and then like individual talking to people and so those kinda overcame those different challenges,0,0.39245568688584626
1849,Yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
1850,So uhm my greatest weakness currently uhm the best way I guess to phrase it would be,0,0.1352367738043197
1851,I guess I feel like I need to be very involved in things I do whether they be like if I'm doing a project or leading an activity I feel like I need to be very on top of whats going on - which is of course a good thing you obviously if your in charge of something you want to be aware of whats happening,1,0.8088170427287866
1852,But I think its my weakness because it allows me to not allocate enough to other people and it cop me to stress myself out and possibly not have as good as a final project because I've taken too much on for myself,0,0.1352367738043197
1853,So that's obviously a kind of weakness and uhm what I've kinda been currently doing to counter it,0,0.04151446662050083
1854,is uhm really working on finding like friends to kinda like overview what I'm doing especially if I'm involved in,0,0.23226963873358347
1855,Very specifically delligating stuff to them and working on kinda like not doing as much and trusting others to do stuff and get the job done and let someone work without checking in to really promote like letting them to go do their own thing and not concern myself with it obviously responsibly but also at the same time to not over burden myself,0,0.11161482957460721
1856,Okay,0,0.2387154408523499
1857,Uhhhmmm sure,0,0.2387154408523499
1858,Uhm so I think I bring a lot to the table by having been here for 2 and a half years here at MIT,0,0.4316075683376617
1859,I've gained a lot of technical skills of course I've taken a lot of classes and done a lot of laboratory research,1,0.6490718829987913
1860,I've done a lot of projects through those classes,0,0.3938730607112474
1861,And so I think I have a lot of technical skills and uhm I in this position at this company would really have the ability to take these skills and combine them and applying them with the other skills I've picked up here which are leadership and communication skills,0,0.058349808998298384
1862,Uhm cause right now they've kinda been in separate realms where I do a lot of activities on campus where I've had the opportunity to plan events and I've kinda been able to take those skills and apply them towards like a technical related problem on which I would be able to do at this company and hone both of those together which I think would be very advantageous for me and very advantageous for you as a company Uhm and really allow me to show off the abilities I've learned here,0,0.22322479893436015
1863,Yeah of course,0,0.2387154408523499
1864,I’m actually doing pretty well,0,0.31213544981287855
1865,I’m just uh I would say well let’s see,1,0.6490718829987913
1866,It’s the end of the semester right after Thanksgiving break,0,0.2115156921086478
1867,So I have a bunch of time to relax and that sort of thing,0,0.09444753853762607
1868,This is the first time I didn’t get home though,0,0.3022838906250506
1869,Um so I spent a bunch of time actually with my friends from my fraternity,0,0.12805425526188313
1870,And we had Thanksgiving dinner together,0,0.1066093052570166
1871,The turkey the whole shebang,0,0.2387154408523499
1872,Um most people around this time have all sort of exams that sort of thing,0,0.2869118389241647
1873,But all things considered compared to like freshman sophomore junior year um I’m actually taking an extra semester to technically still a junior,0,0.06788794010145202
1874,Um it’s pretty relaxed,0,0.39245568688584626
1875,Things are good,0,0.39245568688584626
1876,Well to start um I guess to start,1,0.6100299707868481
1877,The three things I’m doing right now: I’m president of my fraternity SAE which I also helped start up,0,0.4716025486650735
1878,It’s just one of the new fraternities that just you know came out of nowhere,0,0.2903869332990904
1879,We were back on campus awhile ago but that’s history um,0,0.33141366362000685
1880,I’m a late grower and I’m also a chemical engineer,0,0.4730831849790573
1881,Most people have to say Course 10 for their major that sort of thing uh,0,0.2387154408523499
1882,And I’m part of the growing engineer leadership program,0,0.09444753853762607
1883,So uh all things considered I would say that the the things that I’ve come to learn the most since coming to MIT are leadership skills being confident being able to go in front of people and uh sort of create a vision,0,0.1768600974688769
1884,Helping people follow that vision,0,0.39245568688584626
1885,I have had issues in the past of time management,0,0.21250816544335416
1886,But I spent a long time doing like freshman sophomore year learning the importance of sleep,0,0.1768600974688769
1887,Bunch of things like that,0,0.39245568688584626
1888,I’ve gone through the whole all the trials and tribulations,0,0.3938730607112474
1889,But all things considered I’d say pretty much right now I’m smooth like in a groove doing my own kind of thing,0,0.1768600974688769
1890,Things that I want to do,0,0.3022838906250506
1891,And having a good time,0,0.13457995866975905
1892,Well just like this whole semester,0,0.39245568688584626
1893,Um since I’ve been like the president of my fraternity there have been situations with people who are called brothers,0,0.4716025486650735
1894,Where they for some reason they have these issues that they can’t talk about,0,0.11521478613197428
1895,I’m the kind of person that I can tell when someone is having,0,0.4730831849790573
1896,I sort of like pry not pry but press a little bit until they either like to decided to like tell me more or tell me what’s going on,0,0.35729155202333646
1897,There was one case in the sense that mattered but there was a person that um that became a pledge of our fraternity he came from the previous president,0,0.33141366362000685
1898,It’s called rush (talking over each other),0,0.2387154408523499
1899,Basically what happened is this guy came in and very few people knew him when he came in but once they got to know him over the summer they didn’t like him at all,0,0.22382088283936255
1900,So I had to deal with the situation of trying to find out what to do,0,0.09444753853762607
1901,Like do we let him stay? Or let him go through the program and see if he improves? Or do we sort of like nip it in the bud right there? Uh it brought first off I didn’t even want to bring that information up until I’d talked to a bunch of people,0,0.25353811833686407
1902,So I talked to a bunch of people individually got a feel for it,0,0.118032441819917
1903,Then I sort of predicted how the conversation was going to go,0,0.09444753853762607
1904,Ultimately what ended up happening was uh We had to find a really nice way of letting the guy go,0,0.13383961779227607
1905,It was sort of touchy feely sensitive stuff,0,0.2115156921086478
1906,I really had to let to make sure I talked to everyone before that happened,0,0.23333067621579343
1907,Course 10,0,0.2387154408523499
1908,Chemical engineering,0,0.2387154408523499
1909,ICE,0,0.2387154408523499
1910,You are given a challenge in a team,0,0.13115931029929018
1911,Most people you can actually choose your team,0,0.12181721958335275
1912,Most people throughout there are there fun people good at working with (inaudible) that sort of thing,0,0.2115156921086478
1913,Uh but by the time I went to choose my team most of my friends had been swooped up,0,0.3022838906250506
1914,So I was working with kind of a random group of people,0,0.09444753853762607
1915,Which kind of worked out,0,0.39245568688584626
1916,It turned out pretty well,0,0.39245568688584626
1917,The project itself,0,0.2387154408523499
1918,You have to design a chemical engineering plant,0,0.13115931029929018
1919,So you have to do the reactors you have to do the flow the mass flow the distribution com center etc,0,0.08967900877249617
1920,And then there’s a big report,0,0.07018898356424853
1921,There’s all sorts of stuff,0,0.2387154408523499
1922,In general breakdown there’s one person who sort of becomes like the expert for the program the Aspen program,0,0.2115156921086478
1923,And then there’s another person whose more like working on the actual write up and then there’s another person that sort of integrates the two,0,0.13457995866975905
1924,What what as the question? Working in a team?,0,0.12279001203990068
1925,Ok um I guess the biggest issue that came up in that project was the deadline,0,0.2397396965153384
1926,Two and three days before the actual deadline the final project was due the main issue came up the kiln wasn’t working the project wasn’t working,0,0.11521478613197428
1927,So it’s a pretty typical MIT scenario,0,0.16634557565434505
1928,The main thing that was the issue was that the guy that was responsible for doing the coding was a really silent guy,0,0.08335277541638189
1929,So he was like the silent coder that was off doing his own work when you’re trying to integrate it into the rest of the project um we should have collaborating a lot but this other guy was sort of off in his own world,0,0.29160838405168515
1930,So when we needed his part of the project it was sort of difficult to do,0,0.04721556736134647
1931,So what we had to do was we had to sit down all three of us together and go play by play with this guy to sort of get the medium that they left,0,0.050575491362774505
1932,To sort of get the project together,0,0.2387154408523499
1933,Um and I would say the hardest part was just interacting with this man because he was very quiet,0,0.4716025486650735
1934,He did get a lot of quality work done but looking back what I would have tried to do better was noticed he was a quieter person and really tried to get him to be more uh evocative,0,0.23226963873358347
1935,You know sharing the thoughts and stuff that he was doing during like the feed,0,0.2372142273492121
1936,The project we ended up delivering on time up to spec but it would have been better if we had started with the issue at the beginning,0,0.2977831921157918
1937,Yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
1938,At the end of every single like group that I’m with everyone gets to the sort of critique phase where they see what they’ve done well and what they haven’t done as well,0,0.4716025486650735
1939,I can sort of like come of as being a little bit well gregarious is one thing,1,0.5724056014340263
1940,Um but also sometimes I can sort of dominate a conversation,1,0.5338463461786015
1941,Um so that’s one thing I learned from the Growing Engineer leadership program,0,0.3022838906250506
1942,And the identify each of your skills and find out that you’re bad at it,0,0.03930246502748748
1943,And the thing that I’m really trying to work on is not dominating the conversation,0,0.06788794010145202
1944,I’ve been working on it over the years,0,0.3938730607112474
1945,And the main ways I try to do that is first off don’t be the guy who always takes the leadership role right from the get go,0,0.1768600974688769
1946,What I do is instead if there's a little bit of if some one is having a hard time I’ll start giving suggestions,0,0.07434444441773179
1947,And then people can start jumping on to those suggestions,0,0.07018898356424853
1948,And if I notice there is a person who is really good at like engaged who really wants to take this forward,0,0.06788794010145202
1949,I’ll find a way to make it so they become the leader,0,0.3938730607112474
1950,And so instead of me directing everyone and sort of imposing I really ask for everyones input,0,0.014469458775212067
1951,And make it so everyone feels involved,0,0.11684632517741134
1952,So this is more of not a one example but a change that’s in progress,0,0.13457995866975905
1953,I think how I was at the beginning just sort of loud mouth asking a lot of questions like sort of this is how we are going to do everything,1,0.6803188305415496
1954,Now it’s like I volley around ideas and try to get other peoples input instead,1,0.5338463461786015
1955,Yeah I’ve been thinking about that for awhile,0,0.4316075683376617
1956,Well the thing about consulting is that the main reason why it’s intriguing me right now is because it’s the kind of job where everything is fast paced,0,0.39245568688584626
1957,But two it’s the critical factor is teamwork,0,0.030395260313939607
1958,Working with other people who are a variety of ages,0,0.39245568688584626
1959,Being able to extract information and essentially be able to do a project that has a very short timeline,0,0.2869118389241647
1960,It has a timeline it has a scope got a budget,0,0.2387154408523499
1961,Being able to do find different resources make connections and building relationships with new people,0,0.2387154408523499
1962,Which I think is one of the most important things building relationships with people is critical,0,0.3937983692193587
1963,And then being able to sort of patent those new projects while also being find out or getting a breadth or a feel for so many different fields,0,0.08830690875445948
1964,I thought about semi-conductors and decide to not do semi-conductors because of the class I’m taking right now,1,0.7642480901805394
1965,I think team work is the most critical part of the matter,0,0.4935031908514253
1966,Uh so I'm uh I guess I was born in DC,0,0.4316075683376617
1967,I lived in Maryland until I was seven,0,0.4730831849790573
1968,Then my parents decided it would be a good idea to move to Nigeria which is where we're from,0,0.25353811833686407
1969,And I lived the next seven years of my life there and I came back to America for Junior and Senior year of college of high school,0,0.09444753853762607
1970,Once I did that um in Sag (?),0,0.15248303418968046
1971,But like during that period I sort of I found an interest in kind of engineering so I decided to apply at MIT you know it's the best engineering school,0,0.0937418680949876
1972,And I uh I got accepted there,0,0.09444753853762607
1973,And I'm here right now in Junior year,0,0.1768600974688769
1974,Uh yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
1975,That's all,0,0.2387154408523499
1976,Acted as a leader um well in my one of my classes I was taking this semester it's uh 212 Intro to Robotics and it was uh like the lab portion of the class is a group project and so there are four people and there has to be a team leader to get everyone organized and get everyone on the same page,0,0.4716025486650735
1977,Everyone know what's going on,0,0.2387154408523499
1978,Um and I sort of volunteered myself uh as a leader and it's been it's actually been much harder than I thought,0,0.20470832345123025
1979,Working with different people who want do to different things I guess for this project and so just organizing everyone and sort of focusing everyone has been an interesting challenge,1,0.6100299707868481
1980,Uh uh uh I guess for my another class Im taking this semester which is Design and Manufacturing there's a group of eight people and we're tasked with designing and manufacturing a hundred helios (sp) um yeah and so I guess the the the prerequisite to the class was uh Design and Manufacturing 1 where we had to make one robot,0,0.22419003988946132
1981,And sort of that was more individual but here we're tasked with the the big thing here is manufacturing and so I it's easy for everyone to want to decide to design this helio but you have to consider the manufacturing aspect like how easy would it be to make if you're making a ton of them,0,0.3071236897231417
1982,And so this was a challenge getting everyone to agree on sort of one design idea and I sort of I brought up I made it I made sure to let everyone know it wasn't just the design that we're worrying about it's also and more so the manufacturing aspects,0,0.06408131848943939
1983,Uh so I'm not I say I like public speaking but I'm not very good at it,0,0.1768600974688769
1984,I say that's one of my greatest weaknesses um and sort of working on it hasn't been hard just because it's something I like doing,0,0.43441758665660263
1985,Um and so like given opportunities I try to be the leader of a certain group,0,0.4716025486650735
1986,That way I talk to I'm talking to the whole group a lot,0,0.3022838906250506
1987,That sort of helps my speaking,0,0.3022838906250506
1988,And just like in class projects particularly humanities I try to focus on taking ones where there's public speaking involved not just writing essays,0,0.1768600974688769
1989,Okay,0,0.2387154408523499
1990,Yeah sure,0,0.2387154408523499
1991,Uh because I am as I'm a junior at MIT and um this is a good place to find sort of the best engineers some of the best engineers in the world and student sort of interns and I'd do I'd do a great job interning at this company sort of because of the experience I have previously and the knowledge combine that with the knowledge I'm getting here at a world class institute,0,0.4716025486650735
1992,I think that'd make me well-qualified,1,0.7011590230711708
1993,Hi I'm Jacob,1,0.7997339826612094
1994,Pleased to meet you,0,0.45741044182905144
1995,Good,1,0.9036480987850044
1996,How are you?,0,0.15445987288440202
1997,I'm a junior at MIT studying math and science and Im looking for a summer internship at your company this summer,1,0.5395318149680698
1998,So I'm actually currently president of two student groups on campus,0,0.03414728906078335
1999,The Educational studies program which runs uh large scale educational programs for middle and high school students where they take classes taught by MIT students,0,0.2387154408523499
2000,And the MIT Mystery Hunt which is a one weekend event in January with thousands of MIT students and other community members come to participate in a large multi-day sort of puzzle competition,0,0.030395260313939607
2001,I'd be happy to go into detail about either of those but I have plenty of stories to tell,1,0.6490718829987913
2002,Okay,0,0.2387154408523499
2003,So one thing that comes to mind is a couple months ago I was in a robotics competition at MIT called Mass Lab,0,0.09444753853762607
2004,So it's an autonomous robotics competition where you have to design build program the robot from scratch,0,0.07772698000874113
2005,And I was in charge of programming the robot for the team,0,0.09444753853762607
2006,We ran into several problems with the vision libraries we were trying to use in order to try to track the balls and field elements just weren't working for us,0,0.17070910373751436
2007,We spent probably the first half of the month trying to get these to work for the team and um eventually just decided that it would be easier for us to start from scratch and uh write everything ourselves,0,0.3523851046866215
2008,Sort of by you know throwing out the assumption that we should work with the code we were given and starting from (?) principles we were able to actually um get our vision to,0,0.3669421042737519
2009,Okay,0,0.2387154408523499
2010,Um I guess one of the weaknesses I've found is that I tend not to know when to ask for help,0,0.2397396965153384
2011,So for instance at my internship last summer this is something that my mentor pointed out to me several times,0,0.09444753853762607
2012,If I got stuck on a problem I would just see what I could do about it you know Google around for the solution see if anyone else had encountered the problem and then only after a couple of days of trying to work around it then talk to someone,0,0.3829632284737189
2013,Whereas you know if I just asked someone for help the first day they could say Oh I ran into this problem last month,0,0.19015119047044987
2014,This is how you fix it and avoid me sort of this hassle of trying to Google and figure it out on my own,0,0.19015119047044987
2015,So I um I definitely started to become more aware of this over the summer and made a conscious effort to when I was having a problem you know look at my watch and figure out how much time I was wasting trying to solve it,0,0.05350031627826969
2016,If it got to me more than half an hour on my own I would just poke someone next to me and ask them,0,0.3022838906250506
2017,I think just sort of continuing that and trying to make sure that I'm keeping up the habit of ensuring that I'm not getting stuck on my own should help,0,0.39521743774958146
2018,Okay,0,0.2387154408523499
2019,That's an interesting question,0,0.39245568688584626
2020,Um I think I think so a lot of the candidates you've seen probably um come in with similar abilities,0,0.497733547164182
2021,You know students at schools like MIT tend to be very top at the top of their class,0,0.2372142273492121
2022,Um so I wouldn't say there's much that differentiates me there,0,0.3022838906250506
2023,But I would say that I think I would get along well with your company,0,0.32951325534129816
2024,Um I people who have worked with me before have told me that I'm just sort of a fun person to be on a team with,0,0.4716025486650735
2025,Um so if you sort of look out to other aspects beyond just the numbers or GPA or what's on my resume you know try to maybe you know if you want me to hang around at have hang out at the office for a couple of days and you know work with you guys we can see how that goes I'm confident that uh you'd think I you would conclude that I would be a good fit here,1,0.5726796704899698
2026,Any other questions?,0,0.2387154408523499
2027,I'm good how about you?,1,0.6359670093958226
2028,Uh so I'm a junior majoring in biology at MIT,0,0.3022838906250506
2029,Um I'm interested in approaching graduate school in biological oceanography,0,0.3022838906250506
2030,Um I'm also doing a minor in chemistry,0,0.3022838906250506
2031,I currently work in the Thompson Lab here at MIT,1,0.5724056014340263
2032,Um I would say so uh I'm the vice president of Campus Outreach here at MIT's teenage beauty,0,0.2704138274778955
2033,Um yeah so we're in charge of generally reaching out to the student population here at MIT,0,0.3887681302185169
2034,Um so what I've done is basically try and form partnerships with maybe clinics in the Boston area like Fenway Health and try to get them to maybe set up screenings here at MIT,1,0.5338463461786015
2035,Um I would say probably in my previous lab this past summer I worked in Israel and we were having a lot of trouble with just um figuring out a protocol for how to um culture the bacteria that we were trying to do,0,0.4291592311319982
2036,So it was generally just like getting input from everybody and um trying not to get heated because we were kind of like pressed for results,0,0.23979299191356468
2037,Uh I would say one weakness is probably that I don't um speak up very much or I would prefer not to speak up maybe so that probably maybe leaves opportunities or maybe give less input than I would in certain situations,0,0.32230062042973917
2038,So um what I'm doing to overcome that is probably more of maybe not concrete things really but hopefully just trying to get more experience so that I can maybe feel more confident about myself,0,0.11320191250810435
2039,I think because I really have a passion for this field,1,0.5235537960611565
2040,I cannot imagine myself doing anything other than research,0,0.4730831849790573
2041,It is definitely what I want to do for the rest of my life and I think I would be a good candidate for academia,1,0.6100299707868481
2042,Uh I'm an MIT undergraduate junior studying mechanical engineering,0,0.3022838906250506
2043,And I'm doing the flexible course which allows me to concentrate um in an area other than mechanical engineering,0,0.1768600974688769
2044,I chose building technology and I'm hoping to get a double minor in energy and architecture as well,1,0.6490718829987913
2045,I'm sorry?,1,0.741340820829141
2046,Yes,0,0.2387154408523499
2047,Um I have taken on several leadership roles in my sorority,0,0.3022838906250506
2048,Um one of the most recent roles was a CPW chair so um our university uh holds a weekend uh to invite prospective students who have been accepted but have not decided to come to MIT yet,0,0.33141366362000685
2049,And it's an important time to show them how great MIT is but also to give them a taste of different activities on campus,0,0.13457995866975905
2050,Um so I organized a dinner at our house with a co-chair and then this year I'm planning all of our outer-social events,0,0.4064865837293959
2051,So there are basically three large um formal events,0,0.07018898356424853
2052,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
2053,So in high school I was really involved on the robotics team,0,0.03414728906078335
2054,Um there I had three other teammates,0,0.3022838906250506
2055,And it was very difficult to narrow down ideas everyone had like different views different opinions about how we should do things,0,0.11581967354018562
2056,Um and I think that communication was the most important thing making sure that like that we were putting our ideas on the table but also listening to each other,1,0.7120528119563496
2057,I thought that was one of the most important um factors in our success,1,0.7876402910048342
2058,We ended up doing pretty well as a group,1,0.5052336361306978
2059,Yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
2060,One of my weaknesses is kind of um going out of my comfort zone as far as what I'm studying,0,0.2704138274778955
2061,So I think that uh in high school because I was so involved in robotics I didn't really look outside of mechanical engineering,0,0.058349808998298384
2062,And then my parents are also architects which is where that came from,0,0.09444753853762607
2063,So there are two things that I'm really passionate about but I feel that especially being at MIT there are so many other areas I am kind of neglecting,0,0.11320191250810435
2064,Particularly the arts I just don't really feel um I feel its important to have a bounds and not really achieving that right now,0,0.34651595146154224
2065,Um I believe that I have a very strong educational background in the field,0,0.4716025486650735
2066,Um I I'm really passionate about the subject,0,0.23226963873358347
2067,It's something that I've been exposed to in the past because my parents are architects,0,0.3022838906250506
2068,Um but at the same time I think it's something that I think is very important for the future um in terms of like energy consumption,1,0.6100299707868481
2069,Um I wasn't sur,0,0.3022838906250506
2070,I knew I wanted to go into some sort of like energy field at MIT and I think I finally found one that I really enjoy,1,0.5235537960611565
2071,(Laughs),0,0.2387154408523499
2072,Uh good how are you?,0,0.45741044182905144
2073,Um uh so I'm Rebecca,0,0.3022838906250506
2074,I'm a junior uh studying linguistics,0,0.3938730607112474
2075,Um and I think I'm interested in doing linguistic research after undergrad,0,0.4316075683376617
2076,Um let's see uh so I did a um RA I was an RA in my dorm and we were in charge of leading the group of freshman um in advising them for academic reasons and also in doing that- organizing events around the dorm so I would occasionally be in the uh in the leadership position for that,1,0.6441745759161528
2077,Um let's see uh for a linguistics project we had to do I was working on um a team or a group project,0,0.4064865837293959
2078,And-,0,0.2387154408523499
2079,And uh there was a problem,0,0.030395260313939607
2080,One of the members uh wasn't contributing their work on time,0,0.39245568688584626
2081,Uh one of my weaknesses would probably be shyness,0,0.18755857915192653
2082,Um or fear of like talking in front of people I guess,0,0.3937983692193587
2083,Um but- so I've been doing more projects,0,0.3022838906250506
2084,A lot of times in linguistics we have to give presentations so um I've been doing more of that,0,0.4064865837293959
2085,And I actually uh volunteered to teach a splash class this fall so that involves getting up in front of a lot of people and teaching something,0,0.014469458775212067
2086,And that was actually really fun so I feel like doing things- that was sort of a way or- and I enjoyed what I was teaching about so it seemed less intimidating,0,0.05034229212330959
2087,And I hope that doing things like that will get me over my fear of talking to people so,0,0.08191717026182452
2088,Um I think I have uh pretty strong credentials and uh doing well in my classes and um,1,0.6100299707868481
2089,I really enjoy research and linguistics,0,0.31213544981287855
2090,And I think I would um I think I work well with others and would be able to take on leadership roles if necessary,0,0.27356360199342006
2091,And um I think I would just have a lot to offer,0,0.15455013832531528
2092,I'm good how are you?,1,0.6359670093958226
2093,I'm Amanda I'm a freshman at MIT,0,0.3938730607112474
2094,So,0,0.07018898356424853
2095,I'm currently looking into too courses six and eighteen,0,0.3938730607112474
2096,So,0,0.07018898356424853
2097,And I play cello in the orchestra and I'm a part of Sigma Kappa,0,0.09444753853762607
2098,Yeah one time in High School I was the President of our youth board for United Way which is a non profit that raises money and awareness for social and economic problems,0,0.221435459245776
2099,And then we build and try to change them,0,0.1066093052570166
2100,And so my senior year as part of the youth board we ended up fundraising and starting a new fundraiser,0,0.14153925129016182
2101,And it was hockey game between our hockey team and a private schools hockey team,0,0.1066093052570166
2102,Which wasn't really a fair game but that's okay,0,0.17963402645220658
2103,And it was very down to the wire which we weren't aware of,0,0.1066093052570166
2104,I mean planning an event around winter break is never really easy schedule wise and stuff,0,0.19471463595807417
2105,But it was definitely a challenge for us but it was it ended up being successful and we raised over $4000 for us,0,0.19732153176187164
2106,Yea,0,0.2387154408523499
2107,The organization is definitely one of my favorite um it let's students um like have a way to give back to the community which was a big deal for us since actually that year we lost three kids to suicides via train in a few months,0,0.16569992293552951
2108,And so it was really nice for us to have a way to like actually give back to our community instead of just thinking about it and wishing we could do something so it worked out really nicely for us to like really make a difference,0,0.09659515268243245
2109,I mean in school we get a lot of projects that are group projects,1,0.5067186044464734
2110,And I have noticed that a tend to be a person who when the slack doesn't you know the slack starts to happen is kind of do it and after a while it gets very taxing to pick up for everyone and so I remember senior year we just had this project um in Math,0,0.08202498503907435
2111,And it was just so frustrating to do it by myself and so I set every one and I was like I can't do this on my own anymore and I really need your help,0,0.03797263861152235
2112,And it was really nice because they were my friends and they didn't realize they were doing it,0,0.06788794010145202
2113,And so we like made up a new plan and re divied the work and it worked out in the end,0,0.19732153176187164
2114,Yea,0,0.2387154408523499
2115,I'm kind of a perfectionist and I like everything to work out well,1,0.6490718829987913
2116,Which means that when I'm starting something new sometimes I can't look over the little details that I don't see that will work,1,0.5338463461786015
2117,And I don't get how you can just look past that to see a bigger picture and come with a big idea and then work on the small details later and kind of more detail oriented and then work for the bigger goal,0,0.21899413203219753
2118,So that's definitely been one of my problems and I have been working on getting over that,0,0.04151446662050083
2119,But just thinking about it in the future and just you know you can get there and you look at the bigger goal and then if you divvy it up into smaller tasks its a lot easier to overcome and deal with everything so,0,0.2066034157898696
2120,I think you should hire me because I have had a lot of experience dealing with other people and communicating and making sure that coming up like to come up with the best solution that everyone can hopefully agree with,1,0.8088170427287866
2121,And you know of course not everyone can get their way but it's important to try and get everyone's ideas into one if you can so,0,0.16870585012516354
2122,Okay I'm a computer science major um I'm a senior at MIT and I'm hoping to stay in the area next year,0,0.3022838906250506
2123,I'm looking for a job here,0,0.3938730607112474
2124,And I grew up in South Dakota and little bit in Cambodia grew up on a farm,0,0.09444753853762607
2125,I really enjoy playing music and cooking,0,0.31213544981287855
2126,Probably my two biggest hobbies,0,0.3572911640991484
2127,Well when I was in high school I was the leader of my 4-H club and that involved leading meetings,0,0.4716025486650735
2128,There were a lot of younger kids were involved and I helped them get involved in sewing competitions for example and um things where they could learn about nutrition,0,0.4716025486650735
2129,Um and showing their animals and learning about how to raise an animal well,0,0.39245568688584626
2130,So that was a big leadership role and it was kind of difficult but I definitely learned a lot from it,0,0.04151446662050083
2131,Um I play music with some of my friends in some social settings,0,0.3022838906250506
2132,We've played for a couple of weddings and it's sometimes difficult to coordinate,0,0.20894356666517588
2133,One of my weaknesses is probably procrastination same as a ton of people I'm sure,0,0.18755857915192653
2134,To overcome that I am trying to structure my time and I have a schedule so that Ill do one thing for an hour and one thing for the next hour so if I procrastinate for the whole hour then I feel bad,0,0.0705571610152508
2135,So the idea is to avoid that,0,0.07018898356424853
2136,I think that I am a strong strong learner definitely at whatever new skills since in web development there's always new technologies coming along,1,0.7642480901805394
2137,I am quick at learning those and I really enjoy learning new things,0,0.38535842737456816
2138,And I have a good base with my computer science degree from MIT so I know in general how to think about programming,0,0.21611320583280333
2139,I'm doing well,1,0.5724056014340263
2140,Thanks,1,0.929060350894491
2141,Well I'm Zainab Lasisi,0,0.4716025486650735
2142,I'm a junior majoring in chemical engineering,0,0.3938730607112474
2143,I was originally born in Nigeria,0,0.3938730607112474
2144,Which is in West Africa,0,0.2387154408523499
2145,And I grew up in England and Jamaica before coming to MIT,0,0.09444753853762607
2146,A time I demonstrated leadership,0,0.3022838906250506
2147,I'd probably say at the moment um in my position as the Vice President of the African Students Association at MIT,0,0.3235995787201452
2148,So as the vice president I have to be bas- I have to basically support the president,0,0.1560515835866549
2149,And whenever the president of the association is not there step in,0,0.07018898356424853
2150,And actually be the leader for the association,0,0.024949938481925327
2151,So the African Student's Association is about an organization of uhh that consists of,0,0.07018898356424853
2152,That comprises of about 80 Africans at MIT,0,0.2387154408523499
2153,And it's just all undergraduates,0,0.07018898356424853
2154,And it's all about just keep the African community alive,0,0.07018898356424853
2155,And just so that people know that they have a support system,0,0.13457995866975905
2156,Within uh MIT,0,0.2387154408523499
2157,Cause most of them are like international students,0,0.39245568688584626
2158,So they're very far away from home,0,0.07018898356424853
2159,So it's like having a home away from home,0,0.13457995866975905
2160,for them,0,0.2387154408523499
2161,Yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
2162,I'd probably say my past internship with BP,1,0.5353244206591785
2163,Um I was working on a team,0,0.3022838906250506
2164,I was a process engineer intern,0,0.3938730607112474
2165,And the challenge I had was that I was given a project that they didn't really know what,0,0.03414728906078335
2166,They hadn't the project hadn't been done before,0,0.2387154408523499
2167,It's just something like they had ideas about what they wanted,0,0.39245568688584626
2168,But they had no clear cut visions,0,0.13457995866975905
2169,or anything,0,0.07018898356424853
2170,We just knew the I guess the skill set,1,0.7120528119563496
2171,And the types of things they want from my project,0,0.09444753853762607
2172,So for me just to go about delivering a a tool that's of use to the entire team,0,0.07018898356424853
2173,It is about working with people communicating asking them questions,0,0.2387154408523499
2174,about what exactly it is they what me to do,0,0.12279001203990068
2175,And then doing,0,0.07018898356424853
2176,Then I did like a few modeling things,0,0.1768600974688769
2177,And then I'll show them and then they'll give me feedback and then I'll do some more,0,0.09444753853762607
2178,So that was more about it cause I don't think they had an idea about what they wanted,0,0.15455013832531528
2179,in the first place,0,0.2387154408523499
2180,They just knew okay we want this model to do this and do that and do that,0,0.33141366362000685
2181,We're not too sure how it's going to do it but you know just come up with some things,0,0.13474691236493075
2182,It was all on me to use my creativity and just pick people's brains and just come up with,0,0.3022838906250506
2183,Deliver something that's of use to the team,0,0.2387154408523499
2184,I think on of my weaknesses is that um,0,0.39521743774958146
2185,I'd say I'm a very independent worker,0,0.4730831849790573
2186,So sometimes,0,0.08830690875445948
2187,I try like I don't I- I work too much by myself,1,0.6490718829987913
2188,Whereas in I do work well in teams but I just need to be more forth-,0,0.4716025486650735
2189,Because when I'm given a project I'm like okay I can do this,1,0.6490718829987913
2190,I'll just try to sort it out,0,0.3938730607112474
2191,So I guess one of my weaknesses is like approaching other people,0,0.1352367738043197
2192,especially people that I'm not I don't really know,0,0.12805425526188313
2193,And like asking them questions and things like that,0,0.13457995866975905
2194,So yeah,0,0.07018898356424853
2195,Something I need to to develop my communication skills a little better,0,0.4716025486650735
2196,So,0,0.07018898356424853
2197,I think that I am-,1,0.6114423030620092
2198,I have a wonderful personality,1,0.5724056014340263
2199,I'm great to work with,1,0.5724056014340263
2200,I will do anything that is asked of me,0,0.3938730607112474
2201,with a smile on my face,0,0.4716025486650735
2202,I'll always try my best,1,0.6490718829987913
2203,And I'll be a team player,0,0.09444753853762607
2204,Mmhmm,0,0.2387154408523499
2205,I'm goo,0,0.3938730607112474
2206,I'm doing well how are you?,1,0.6359670093958226
2207,Um so I my background is in mechanical engineering,0,0.3022838906250506
2208,What I really enjoy doing though um is leadership type rolls,0,0.1189851931334644
2209,So I like talking with people but I also like doing technical problems,0,0.08191717026182452
2210,So I'm looking for a position that really combines those two things,0,0.03414728906078335
2211,Uh where I can use my communications skills with people as well as my technical background in a roll that's kinda combin,0,0.4716025486650735
2212,involves decision making uh and different business factors,0,0.2387154408523499
2213,Uh so recently umm I'm the leader of our of a group project that I'm working on,0,0.4064865837293959
2214,Basically what we have to do is design a speech system and with the system uh as leader of our team I do a lot of organizing delegating tasks uh different types of conflict management making sure people are talking understanding whatever everybody's wanting uh different type of just general making sure I'm aware of all the group dynamics that are going on,0,0.11265973375475724
2215,Okay uhh so I was on a team uhh it was actually just two people uh but it was to design and build a robot at the end of last semester and uhh my partner and I have very different working styles which I didn't expect,0,0.03414728906078335
2216,I was kinda have projected my own tendencies on him in assuming that if I was going to finish something he would do the same way or work the same way as I as I was going to,1,0.6490718829987913
2217,Uh but it didn't end up being true and so we ended up at the very end uh not having our final product ready not having everything together and what I ended up doing was just making sure that I used all the resources I had so friends outside of the project who um were willing to help with what was going on uh to try to pull something together made sure I was going to contact my professor and then try to communicate with him as much as possible uh to collaborate with what was going on in order to get um like uh somewhat finished final project ther,1,0.6441745759161528
2218,that was our professor said was acceptable and done by the end about the time we had finished,0,0.33141366362000685
2219,wait the time that we had to finish,0,0.33141366362000685
2220,Uh I think one of my main weaknesses is uh taking on too many little things,0,0.2397396965153384
2221,Umm so sometimes not realizing uh what the little things are that I can let go for a little bit and prioritizing uh large period of times of saying yes to too many things,0,0.3572911640991484
2222,Uh and what I'm mainly trying to do to change that is just keeping track of exactly how I spend my time,0,0.3572911640991484
2223,So recently Ive been really trying to focus in on how long am I really wasting on little tasks and how long I'm actually spending on larger tasks um and I and seeing that is very helpful uh in changing how I prioritize things,0,0.02935760559696661
2224,I'm very dependable,1,0.5724056014340263
2225,I'm responsible,0,0.3938730607112474
2226,I will get things done when they need to be done,0,0.3938730607112474
2227,Uh and I like to communicate with people overcome challenges uh I have been use to working with people with very diverse backgrounds and I'm not afraid of a challenge,0,0.2704138274778955
2228,Um I'm also I'm use to being a team player,0,0.3022838906250506
2229,I've worked on lots of team and know people so uhh I'm also very excited about the vision of the company and whats going on and I think overall uh what I've learned here about the culture would fit me well,1,0.7642480901805394
2230,Um I'm a junior in computer science,0,0.3022838906250506
2231,What sort of things do you want to know about me?,0,0.15445987288440202
2232,I like programming in python,1,0.5724056014340263
2233,I haven't been in computer science that long because I used to be a chemistry major,0,0.4730831849790573
2234,But I've been taking computer science classes for the past year and a half,0,0.09444753853762607
2235,I'm the president of my acapella group so I have to organize publicity things like when we have a performance I have to make sure that everyone knows about the performance so we have an audience,1,0.7451478071734184
2236,I organize details like the reception and the getting a room reserved,1,0.5724056014340263
2237,Hmm m,0,0.2387154408523499
2238,a time when I was working with a team,0,0.3022838906250506
2239,I guess if I could count my acapella group as a team,1,0.6114423030620092
2240,cause I guess it is,0,0.4316075683376617
2241,There are times when we've had conflicts about weather we wanted to sing a specific song,0,0.17070910373751436
2242,For instance often times there would be a song that we really liked but it would take like up a lot of rehearsal time,0,0.30755236816380843
2243,So we didn't think it was worth it or anything cause we had limited time,0,0.15177057591599707
2244,So we had to resolve the conflict by discussing different options,0,0.04721556736134647
2245,I think we finally ended up deciding to sing the song in a future semester,1,0.642912184984852
2246,Later we would still be able to sing it but it wouldn't compromise the rest of our repertoire,0,0.33141366362000685
2247,Hmm m,0,0.2387154408523499
2248,haha,0,0.2387154408523499
2249,um mm,0,0.2387154408523499
2250,can't really think of things that where weaknesses,0,0.05360237764535133
2251,um mm,0,0.2387154408523499
2252,laugh,0,0.2387154408523499
2253,I guess that I have trouble being criticized because I've always been sensitive and,1,0.5737824960575687
2254,When I get criticized by people who aren't as sensitive I I react more strongly to their criticism than they intend me to,0,0.2704138274778955
2255,so I have to learn to realize that some people who aren't as sensitive will criticize harsh more harshly,0,0.08191717026182452
2256,Because I'm excited to work at facebook,0,0.4716025486650735
2257,And because I'm motivated to do things in computer science because I find it really fun,0,0.06788794010145202
2258,I'm good,1,0.5724056014340263
2259,Um I'm from Mumbai,0,0.3022838906250506
2260,I'm a junior in core six,0,0.3938730607112474
2261,When I applied to ITU I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do,0,0.3572911640991484
2262,Um I thought I would do chemical engineering,0,0.4316075683376617
2263,That um that got me super interested in a bunch stuff and um finally decided core six um,0,0.39245568688584626
2264,But then I visit to the media lab before,0,0.09444753853762607
2265,Um now I'm working at the over in um,0,0.3022838906250506
2266,So that's and engines I have been involved with engines here and um a bunch of other um clubs like Energy Club,0,0.1768600974688769
2267,and organizing the Energy Conference and and,0,0.07018898356424853
2268,other workshops,0,0.2387154408523499
2269,So um and in general I'm super interested in um hardware show and um computer science like certain aspects of computer science really interests me too so,0,0.06788794010145202
2270,Yeah I'm interested you know to learn,0,0.3611869277514505
2271,Um sure,0,0.2387154408523499
2272,So well this is the most recent example,0,0.13457995866975905
2273,I can think of,1,0.532476616497347
2274,But I um was a freshman,0,0.09444753853762607
2275,I was I mean I still am pretty excited about international developments,1,0.6490718829987913
2276,So I joined um um as it was it was it was,0,0.09444753853762607
2277,It wasn't formally ? in the USA but we decided to take it on,0,0.33141366362000685
2278,we wanted so we were willing um sort of ?? low cost easy to setup showers we use in Kenya,1,0.5052336361306978
2279,Um and it was basically something that I've never done before,0,0.3022838906250506
2280,computer science people you you know trying ??,0,0.2903869332990904
2281,But their view was,0,0.07018898356424853
2282,it's not,0,0.2387154408523499
2283,So um that was a great thing for me to get involved with,0,0.13457995866975905
2284,And um that summer I went and traveled with them to Kenya,0,0.09444753853762607
2285,Um and that was a great experience,0,0.39245568688584626
2286,So coming back um I was uh elected as,0,0.09444753853762607
2287,That was um that was a great thing cuz one it's it's important to kind of realize that you might not have all the answers but that's fine,1,0.5196231351181234
2288,You know you can learn,0,0.16458277299120885
2289,You knew wanna be teens etc,0,0.13115931029929018
2290,But it was like despite not knowing anything about mechanical engineering I was able to sort of understand and learn um sort of graduate to eventually becoming um,0,0.1768600974688769
2291,taking on a leadership within that community,0,0.2387154408523499
2292,Yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
2293,Um so we had this uh we had this asphalt called which is basically um you do you make them overlap,0,0.3927973489599513
2294,And you sort of um pretend as if it's something that you're actually making for industry,0,0.013677923384974415
2295,And um there were four people on the team to program,0,0.07018898356424853
2296,Whereas there was me who was kind of like I know how to do it but you know I I could do with more instruction,0,0.21899413203219753
2297,There was someone who was just starting,0,0.2387154408523499
2298,She wa- she was a freshman that year,0,0.2387154408523499
2299,Um but she was great,0,0.39245568688584626
2300,And uh we decided to make this app with um when you have two iPhones uh you can swipe like you can bump them and uh whatever's on one phone the other one,0,0.11756413756074154
2301,could split them,0,0.11521478613197428
2302,It was something that you know we we hadn't done before,0,0.3927973489599513
2303,Not a ton of people have done it,0,0.2387154408523499
2304,And um at the media lab there was this technology that of I don't know discovered ?? um called Swipe,0,0.04151446662050083
2305,And they just swipe from one to the other and we we thought that would be great,0,0.15177057591599707
2306,And it someone like a student like us who had done it,0,0.19732153176187164
2307,Um we but we we didn't realize that it was not production ready and then,1,0.5052336361306978
2308,And you know we have all these bugs and stuff,0,0.06074309713506123
2309,And we have no documentation to go to,0,0.1066093052570166
2310,But there was this one person on the team you know being you know the awesome programmer he is insisted on going that way when,0,0.16870585012516354
2311,Like when we met the founder of Swipe he was saying you know what just don't use it it's not optimized for the stuff that you guys are sending,0,0.3562570264627702
2312,across like the data,0,0.39245568688584626
2313,And um so we have the sort of tiff when you know the rest of the team wanted to move on to do the same project using the VPI,0,0.13474691236493075
2314,Which was kind of standard,0,0.2387154408523499
2315,??,0,0.2387154408523499
2316,And whereas we infinitely could deduce fiber we just didn't the resources at the time,0,0.1066093052570166
2317,So um you know he was re- he was really experienced and he can't even say you know you don't what you are doing,0,0.032314596074012804
2318,Because he,0,0.2387154408523499
2319,didn't know,0,0.2387154408523499
2320,what he doing,0,0.12279001203990068
2321,So eventually we were able to convince him that we should probably go with whatever we wanted,0,0.13278584963937465
2322,um as a team instead of you know,0,0.2903869332990904
2323,etc,0,0.2387154408523499
2324,Um so that was that was definitely a challenging situation cuz he's great,0,0.2115156921086478
2325,He's smart,0,0.39245568688584626
2326,And he's super nice and you don't wanna offend anyone,0,0.07772698000874113
2327,Especially when they're your friends,0,0.2903869332990904
2328,You you have to get the work done,0,0.2886839945882999
2329,Is this a technical weakness or,0,0.11521478613197428
2330,OK,0,0.2387154408523499
2331,Um a lot of times this is just something that Cody just taught me,0,0.2387154408523499
2332,That I haven't quite learned um is that whenever you're you know whenever you're in doubt you should just go ahead and do stuff,0,0.23152446905371948
2333,But for me I like to like think about it how exactly I'm gonna lose one,0,0.10272802370478028
2334,if ?? coding,0,0.2387154408523499
2335,Which which which is a problem because sometimes like new solutions come along the way but you can like I do it fast,0,0.3829632284737189
2336,Um and it's OK if stuff work the first time,0,0.39245568688584626
2337,Cuz I kind of wanted to research everything before,0,0.3022838906250506
2338,I start doing stuff,0,0.3938730607112474
2339,Um that's sometimes an issue because then I can't do it as fast,0,0.32230062042973917
2340,If especially if that's something new,0,0.2387154408523499
2341,But um on the other hand sometimes if it works like it works really well cuz I've done my you know homework,0,0.10870280988648662
2342,Right?,0,0.39245568688584626
2343,But uh in general I like if you just just get my hands dirty and then do stuff,0,0.10429856273872934
2344,Yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
2345,Um well because a year ago I didn't know how to code at all,0,0.4716025486650735
2346,And now like like next semester I'm gonna finish up my degree,0,0.1768600974688769
2347,Um as a junior,0,0.2387154408523499
2348,And then I'll probably do math or something else,0,0.118032441819917
2349,But it that just kind of shows you that I'm willing to learn,0,0.21899413203219753
2350,And I'm not afraid of trying new stuff,0,0.04151446662050083
2351,And with this technology will always change,0,0.07018898356424853
2352,And sure if I don't PHP today right now you can use it tomorrow,0,0.21899413203219753
2353,But um I think what's really important is that I'm willing to learn um and I work well with within a team,0,0.11320191250810435
2354,And I also like working by myself,0,0.1768600974688769
2355,So there's like a good balance of what um stuff is ?? yeah I just like hanging with great people and doing great work,0,0.24372173559947308
2356,I'm doing great how are you?,1,0.6359670093958226
2357,Uh so I'm an undergraduate uh in the third year at uh here at MIT and I'm studying computer science,0,0.09444753853762607
2358,Um I am really interested in um applying for a software job,0,0.12805425526188313
2359,Um I want to get more experience in web development and software development and also get some exposure into data science and machine learning,0,0.3022838906250506
2360,And uh see how that plays out in uh the industry setting uh since I've done some research,0,0.09444753853762607
2361,Uhm leadership? So currently I'm on uh the South Asian American Students Exec Board,0,0.09444753853762607
2362,So that's uh basically uh the Indian Cultural club uh for undergrads,0,0.07018898356424853
2363,And uh I'm secretary and community service chair,0,0.09444753853762607
2364,Um So I'm currently organizing um reaching out to groups in the Boston area um and uh groups that work overseas in India with um for charity and community service opportunities that I can connect to uh undergrads here,0,0.4716025486650735
2365,Um And uh I'm also involved in other activities that SAS the group uh is involved in like setting up and planning like uh study breaks,0,0.2704138274778955
2366,Our recent uh garba which is an Indian dance festival,0,0.33141366362000685
2367,And also in I'm in Phi Kappa Theta fraternity and uh I've held leadership positions there uh in my freshman year in our pledge class when I was the community service chair for that as well,0,0.25353811833686407
2368,Uh and led my class of uh 15 in um going out into the community and we went down into different places in Boston and helped clean up streets etc,1,0.5852163666581659
2369,Uh so with this community service uh that my pledge class did for my fraternity,0,0.3022838906250506
2370,Um one glaring problem was getting everybody to respond communicate well and show up,0,0.2115156921086478
2371,Uh a class of 15 isn't too big but when we're all MIT students we're all just getting settled it's kind of hard to keep everybody on task,0,0.17070910373751436
2372,Um so what I did to solve this problem was uh I- once I set up- One thing I did was set up a group text um that I would uh that would basically keep us on touch and um would facilitate making sure that everybody stayed involved and it would be easier to keep track also of who was actually responding,0,0.16569992293552951
2373,Um because people check texts better than emails and that's what we'd been using previously,1,0.5052336361306978
2374,I also tried to um unsuccessfully but um propose uh like a point system basically,0,0.35729155202333646
2375,Uh to reward those who would show up and penalize those who didn't,0,0.2115156921086478
2376,So we also- we have chores basically in our house to keep the house looking clean- house works and crews- and um basically if you accumulated a certain number of um points- points are bad-uh you would have to do extra crews or house works depending on when you didn't show up for an event during our pledge process,0,0.11756413756074154
2377,I think probably my biggest weakness is uh staying focused on tasks,0,0.39521743774958146
2378,Um when I am working on a task and I am focused I am able to work really efficiently and I come up with good ideas,0,0.23226963873358347
2379,Uh but I frequently get distracted,0,0.3572911640991484
2380,However I've been um well on my way to overcoming this uh through friends- working studying with friends who have like trained me to stay more on task,0,0.4716025486650735
2381,Uh Done things like finding better places to work and study with back to school work,0,0.39245568688584626
2382,Um and uh also sleep schedules are frequently a major problem for undergrads in terms of how that affects your study habits,0,0.17901834688044663
2383,And so uh I've been working on that to help stay fresher and more focused when I do my work,0,0.1768600974688769
2384,I think you should hire me because I have a lot of ideas I'm really good at coming up with ideas between table especially in terms of um software development,1,0.5891649519555802
2385,I um projects for school and one or two of my own independent projects I've been working on by myself and with friends,0,0.4730831849790573
2386,I've uh been good at optimization um of software and coming up with good ideas um on the user end,1,0.5724056014340263
2387,So uh I'm able to look at a project from different stand points and think about what all parties would want,0,0.118032441819917
2388,What-what would be easiest for the development team as well as the end users,0,0.22382088283936255
2389,Thank you,1,0.9723827022850665
2390,Mhmm,0,0.2387154408523499
2391,Awesome,1,0.9036480987850044
2392,How about yourself?,0,0.15445987288440202
2393,Well I grew up in Berkley California,0,0.4716025486650735
2394,And I've been interested in medicine my whole life,0,0.09444753853762607
2395,Um my dad worked for UCSF,0,0.4716025486650735
2396,as a researcher but not as a doctor,0,0.2387154408523499
2397,And I would visit him at work and I was always attracted to the hospital side,0,0.1768600974688769
2398,It's much the loud side,0,0.11521478613197428
2399,I want to do research as well,1,0.5724056014340263
2400,Well in high school I was captain of golf team,0,0.4716025486650735
2401,And that was a blast,0,0.07018898356424853
2402,Golf girl’s golf is not super competitive,0,0.39245568688584626
2403,to say the least,0,0.2387154408523499
2404,It's very,0,0.2387154408523499
2405,haphazard and it's usually been one extreme or another,0,0.14316569343261962
2406,Very bimodal,0,0.2387154408523499
2407,Um you've either got these like super serious girls who are parents on the course with them and they're going to be all PGA,0,0.45741044182905144
2408,Or you just girls that are not that athletic just goofing off with golf clubs,0,0.08967900877249617
2409,and doing whatever,0,0.07018898356424853
2410,And Berkeley High is definitely the ladder of that,0,0.07018898356424853
2411,So I uh you know coordinated this group of motley girls along with my coach and we had a lot of competitions where candy was the reward,0,0.1554588016020326
2412,We played a lot of games--we had really a great time,0,0.2571389984462586
2413,But a big part of it is like,0,0.13457995866975905
2414,you know there was like a leadership aspect? We had to like stay organized,0,0.329581874294538
2415,Especially because no one else was,0,0.2387154408523499
2416,And so like making sure we made it to meets and like,0,0.19732153176187164
2417,organizing snacks making sure people showed up,0,0.2387154408523499
2418,Well I mean I can continue the same example because I didn't start off as captain,0,0.4716025486650735
2419,And it's different you know? When you’re the head versus like part of the group,0,0.16870585012516354
2420,Um it's more important when you're a part of the group to be a cohesive part and not like the leader,0,0.45741044182905144
2421,To be able to like understand directions and like,0,0.39245568688584626
2422,I mean if there is an issue like,0,0.35729155202333646
2423,work it out but to be able to take you know instructions and think about it and work with other people and encourage them to do the same,1,0.5196231351181234
2424,So uh this is one time we've encountered an issue,0,0.04721556736134647
2425,So we were going to a meet and you have to travel a lot for golf,0,0.13474691236493075
2426,because golf courses are big and not very common,0,0.2387154408523499
2427,Compared to something like a soccer field,0,0.39245568688584626
2428,So we were going out into the [xx?] of California,0,0.1066093052570166
2429,and our car broke down,0,0.04721556736134647
2430,And it was earrrly in the morning,0,0.07018898356424853
2431,No one had no sleep,0,0.2387154408523499
2432,It was just girls,0,0.2387154408523499
2433,teenage girls no caffeine not enough sugar not enough breakfast,0,0.39245568688584626
2434,And we were in a really old car,0,0.03887770666152822
2435,and my coach was like 30 minutes ahead and we were going to be late,0,0.25353811833686407
2436,We blew a tire actually,0,0.14385601394430575
2437,So we called triple A but it was stressful,0,0.04721556736134647
2438,but we ended playing games and I like led a yoga session in the,0,0.25353811833686407
2439,highway,0,0.2387154408523499
2440,which was you know hilarious,0,0.45741044182905144
2441,And we're there in these ridiculous outfits,0,0.04721556736134647
2442,We're wearing like we,1,0.5052336361306978
2443,at Berkeley High we wore like stupid outfits,0,0.2977831921157918
2444,on purpose; knee high argyles,0,0.2387154408523499
2445,and like polos,0,0.13457995866975905
2446,It was so funny,0,0.11521478613197428
2447,You can only imagine how we looked,0,0.19266118533444368
2448,Um yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
2449,So I'm not super great with being organized,0,0.1768600974688769
2450,Like I'm alright but especially with administrative things like paperwork and,0,0.4716025486650735
2451,uhm I,0,0.3938730607112474
2452,I'm good with deadlines but only if I had set reminders,1,0.6490718829987913
2453,So like even for example trying to get into this building today was an adventure or remembering to fill out all the forms for,0,0.13457995866975905
2454,like my [xx?] and everything is,0,0.4716025486650735
2455,it can be sometimes sort of a struggle,0,0.14316569343261962
2456,Well I love helping people and I'm going to be a great doctor,0,0.1768600974688769
2457,I have good dexterity,1,0.5724056014340263
2458,I like to study,1,0.5724056014340263
2459,I find medicine fascinating,1,0.5724056014340263
2460,fascinating,0,0.39245568688584626
2461,And I feel like I could really make the most impact that way I can utilize,0,0.11320191250810435
2462,utilize my skills the best way possible,1,0.5338463461786015
2463,-ology in order to learn more about like the pharmaceutical aspect of the rain,0,0.39245568688584626
2464,Um and so that’s- I’m trying to get myself towards patent law,0,0.3022838906250506
2465,In pharmaceuticals I guess,0,0.4316075683376617
2466,Well um last semester I was ah a part of the Mentor Core for a student organization on one of MIT’s campus called Amphibious Achievement,0,0.4716025486650735
2467,One of the things as part of the Mentor Core you have a small group of students that you one on one tutor as their mentor and tutor and you meet with them once a week for a five hour study session and they’re inner city High School students who - they don’t have access to the best basic math and reading skills,0,0.45741044182905144
2468,So we meet once a week to go over what we’re going to teach them and we teach them the next day on a Sunday,0,0.1066093052570166
2469,Uhm and so that’s leadership in itself but I took the initiative to plan a sponsorship banquet to thank our very generous donors and so me and another member of the Mentor Core planned uh a sponsorship banquet that I was told went very well,1,0.9833131034163536
2470,So I’m very proud of that,0,0.1768600974688769
2471,Well I guess the one thing that I’ve learned uhm working on several teams throughout my life is uh that communication is necessary um so uh in High School I worked on a team and we had received a grant in order to build an alternative energy um device,1,0.7120528119563496
2472,Um and there was a lot of issues amongst the different committees like so there was an electrical component and there were people trying to build the flotation aspect of it because it was - it was supposed to be in water and there was the water proofing committee,0,0.25606765850548896
2473,And so in terms of communicating deadlines and expectations I think there was a sometimes there could be a breakdown in that because everyone’s busy,0,0.0705571610152508
2474,And you see that here and I saw that a lot back in High School,0,0.11980571834570754
2475,Um and so I was kind of moderating everyone um and so just being able to communicate the expectations um to make it really apparent ‘cause I think we running a lot of high achieving people a lot of the time so as long as they know what they need to do and what’s expected of them I think um at least for me as a high achieving person I - once I know what I need to do I can do it,0,0.289217805672682
2476,And as long as that’s communicated and clear I think that’s necessary to resolve a lot of problems,0,0.1352367738043197
2477,I’d say one of my weaknesses can definitely be in terms of organization,0,0.271587471786791
2478,So if there’s something I know that I need to do um I will definitely get it done but in terms of parsing out the appropriate amount of time sufficiently before hand sometimes that can be lacking to where there can be times I’m scrambling at the last second,0,0.10272802370478028
2479,I always get it done but it’s just in terms of personal stress and maybe stress of people who want to see results over time versus at the end um but I have I’ve gotten a lot better at that especially at MIT because you really can’t mess around with that kind of uh weakness,0,0.09498798017441461
2480,Just with knowing my schedule the month before versus the week before hand,0,0.3022838906250506
2481,And investing in a planner and a calendar has definitely helped me a lot,0,0.13457995866975905
2482,I think because you know I’ve wanted to do it since I was twelve and I think I have a lot that I can give coming from Mit have a back-like the mind set the science and engineering um as and adding that into like the sphere of law I think it would introduce a unique problem solving set and I could have a lot to offer to uh the community of lawyers across the nation,0,0.2972296817653244
2483,Umm I'm good I'm good,1,0.6490718829987913
2484,Umm so I'm a junior at MIT,0,0.3022838906250506
2485,I'm studying brain and cognitive science,0,0.3938730607112474
2486,I'm interested in studying cognitive neuroscience in the future,0,0.3938730607112474
2487,Probably systems level,0,0.2869118389241647
2488,Ok,0,0.2387154408523499
2489,Umm well this past summer I was in China,0,0.4716025486650735
2490,And umm I was helping out with this cognitive learning program,0,0.1768600974688769
2491,And what they do is they try take principles umm learned through research and apply those in the classroom,0,0.03259918180807402
2492,And so-,0,0.07018898356424853
2493,Ok,0,0.2387154408523499
2494,Umm well actually a part of the same program uh we were trying to put up videos of the teaching to give umm examples for other people,0,0.2571389984462586
2495,And uh none of us knew how to program or anything like that and we were we were in China so it was umm both a language barrier and also you know like overcoming that like knowledge gap of not knowing how to program,0,0.2428917736095061
2496,So what we ended up doing was like trying to find a Chinese student who was studying computer science and umm in Beijing and the language thing did come in to play but umm but eventually we were able to like sort of get through that,0,0.09888677476540286
2497,It was a challenge all the way through,0,0.2387154408523499
2498,Yea umm so I have trouble public spe- like getting up in front of people and talking,0,0.2704138274778955
2499,Umm which is part of why I came in to this interview,0,0.3022838906250506
2500,Umm but also this semester I joined the debate team,0,0.3022838906250506
2501,Umm which has been great so far,0,0.39245568688584626
2502,Umm basically we go around to different colleges for tournaments and umm we get up and we just speak for for an hour,0,0.3887681302185169
2503,And umm and that's that's really helped out so far,0,0.05007391579932511
2504,Umm because I I want to make a difference in this field,0,0.3022838906250506
2505,Umm I'm very very committed to this [??] I mean I know this is what I want to do,0,0.4730831849790573
2506,I mean there's really nothing else I can see myself in the future doing,0,0.23333067621579343
2507,I mean I love it I'm fully committed and umm I'd I'd like to make a difference here,1,0.6490718829987913
2508,I'm well thank you,1,0.9864801121167501
2509,How about yourself?,0,0.15445987288440202
2510,Um well as you probably know I'm a Junior in MIT ah material science and engineering and i've spent a bit of time doing some research in material science but i've also recently declared a maj- ah minor in course two,0,0.26459270552821346
2511,Which is sorry its mechanical engineering,1,0.5803657338044622
2512,Umm so I'm looking for a bit of practice in industry,0,0.3022838906250506
2513,Now that I've had some research experience I've a lot of range of classes in engineering,0,0.3022838906250506
2514,And I'm hoping to ah to kind of try out what it's like to engineer um combine the two basically mechanical and materials engineering,0,0.1768600974688769
2515,Ok um I could give you an example of a club I'm in?,0,0.3611869277514505
2516,Um in at MIT I'm in Amnesty International which is a student human rights organization-,0,0.3022838906250506
2517,And it's very um decentralized it's very student owned and uh we kinda make it what ever we wanna make it-,0,0.1066093052570166
2518,at any given time so it takes a lot of initiative to-,0,0.2387154408523499
2519,really hold the club together and uh we were trying to pull together a big event last semester which involved Professor N-,0,0.14385601394430575
2520,and we had to talk about Arab spring and we were hosting it in a huge lecture hall um so big venue hoping expecting a lot of people,0,0.1066093052570166
2521,Um but it took a lot of work-,0,0.2387154408523499
2522,And none of us had really pulled such a huge event before-,0,0.03887770666152822
2523,So um I'd say it took it took a lot of initiative that I hadn't taken before in pulling that event together,0,0.09444753853762607
2524,I came to meetings and made sure everyone was on task made sure,0,0.3938730607112474
2525,that everybody had an awareness of what could go wrong as well as what could um what kind of repercussions we might be expecting if things did fall out of hand with the high high profile speakers-,0,0.3523851046866215
2526,as well as some you know some contentious issues-,0,0.25930501603055445
2527,being discussed so um yeah I did my best to really pull the team together as best as I could,0,0.23226963873358347
2528,Um I didn't have an official leadership role-,0,0.3022838906250506
2529,So my participation was ambiguously defined but um it was fun having uh having a role,0,0.1768600974688769
2530,Um that's a good question,0,0.39245568688584626
2531,Um so I was on the orientation group I was an orientation leader this-,0,0.3022838906250506
2532,this the beginning of this year and so we paired off into different groups uh we were the brown team and we had a few problems with getting energy with the team and uh all of these freshman we knew that they were excited to be there-,0,0.2977831921157918
2533,We knew that they wanted to get to know each other and MIT but there was just there was something blocking them from talking and from getting out of orientation what they should have so we uh we pulled together as a bit of a brown group team we had a group discussion after I think it was the second day and we took this um we took a few tries to pull together some new ice breakers that hadn't been in the booklet that they prepared us for and just uh whipped that out the next day started yelling got the kids off their feet and jumping and um my one of my other co-orientation leaders and I were yelling different questions at them and they had to pair up or group up based on the question that we asked them and it didn't really work necessarily um everybody participated though and it got them got the blood moving and it go them kind of talking to new people so even though the game didn't have a point it ended up being kind of fun it was a good good way of getting to know my teammates a well,0,0.1679107013538831
2534,So we worked together really well on that,0,0.07692020109018043
2535,Yes,0,0.2387154408523499
2536,Um so I have a weakness for over-committing sometimes and uh what I have been doing in the last year or so well since I came to MIT but particularly this year is cutting back on things that don't mean much to me,0,0.32230062042973917
2537,Cutting back on things that are that have always just been interest that I never see myself progressing in,0,0.3022838906250506
2538,So um for example I was uh I took a small leadership role in my sorority like my my freshman year but I wasn't I don't see myself going very far in leadership in my sorority so I cut that kind of thing out and I've been focusing on classes sailing I'm on the sailing team and uh Amnesty International and those are my three main focus things so although I do do other things,0,0.1768600974688769
2539,Like I was and orientation leader um when I have time I give tours from thats my job campus tour guiding but um I've been getting better I've been staying more on track with classes this way and um having sailing has definitely helped so a bit of self-discipline-,0,0.1768600974688769
2540,And uh cutting back on things has helping me uh not overcommit,0,0.13457995866975905
2541,Um because I've researched into your country sorry into your company and um I think uh I think it's I see a lot of I see a lot it in the experience that I've had in I've had international experience in companies of a scales similar to yours although it was in the research department um and I think I cold bring that coo- that um international perspective I've lived in several countries as well uh and I have besides being and engineer I have a lot practice with team work and with leadership roles in my community and my student groups even in my p-set groups um doing homework,1,0.6843040110284957
2542,We have to pull together a lot of presentations and a lot of uh group reports where the materials signs major here and I've really uh I've developed a lot of skills that I think will really help your company,0,0.3468404516841437
2543,Okay so I’m a junior here at MIT I’m [???] um and I guess so it’s an interesting combo but engineering and ECS and I think I just came to MIT thinking I’d do bioengineering and then I guess I took a program class for the first time my freshman year over IP and I guess I just really fell in love with the logic,0,0.09898247874719385
2544,I worked in a couple of biology labs and I guess the one frustrating thing is that like experiments take weeks or months to set up sometimes things just go wrong and you don’t really know why,0,0.3732504393774121
2545,And then I think I like the instantaneous feedback of like [???] so last year I decided to double major and this year I’m really checking out the more computer science side of things,0,0.11320191250810435
2546,Okay um so I think I’m on my class council so one of the things we have to do was to seven people elected every year our job was to plan events for the class for event unity just like study breaks but sometimes it goes beyond that,1,0.5066404005866445
2547,And I guess through that role often times I’ve um just like seen an idea from inception all the way to it’s now in planning to like delegating tasks to day of to day of execution and just following that entirely through,0,0.27356360199342006
2548,So I guess that just involved first just coming out brainstorming some ideas so like for example this past week on Tuesday since it’s a hell week for many people at MIT we decided to have instead of like a big study break where people had to go on campus we rented out a cookie monster truck from Boston and then just drove around,0,0.19821442239249298
2549,We had six stops on campus to like it was all the dorms and even across the river to bring the study break to them so people didn’t have to spend that much time just cookies and hot cocoa,0,0.2977831921157918
2550,So I guess my role is well I thought of the idea and then just coordinate the people and made shifts to people and designed the stops and then just made sure publicity was good and everything came together in the end,0,0.27356360199342006
2551,Okay,0,0.2387154408523499
2552,So I guess I’m in a fraternity and then one of the things we have like a lot of officers and I guess one of the things is that sometimes people obviously it’s MIT people get very busy and I guess one of the things is people maybe they have an ambitious goal and then it just happens that they get busy or like they lose track of things and then uh they get side tracked and it’s always challenging to try to keep them engaged into that officer position and like because for a couple of reasons: one like do you want to make it rewarding for then two you want to see them follow their goals and three they’re like setting an example for say like younger students or other people that may be interesting,0,0.2439282069851289
2553,So I guess the challenge then is to overcome this so I’m usually following up with them individually seeing like maybe like hey like what’s up are you no longer interested in this are you just busy? And then I think it depends on like a case by case basis,0,0.32951325534129816
2554,Like are they just maybe a little bit absent minded then maybe like setting like weekly just like deliverables or like milestones or goals to like get it done piece by piece is one way,0,0.45321313756248316
2555,If they’re not interested anymore maybe you try to think of like some other idea that they may be interested in or willing to plan to maybe they can work in a group with someone else so someone else can keep them on track,1,0.5196231351181234
2556,So I guess it’s just tailoring to the solution to the individual problem,0,0.0705571610152508
2557,Okay um I think sometimes I can be um a little like uh like unsure of myself or like doubting when making a very large decision so I guess usually in leadership roles I prefer something like second in command since I do like making sure things get done and like following up to make sure but I always like the fall back of having someone else to consult with to talk about uh my thought process and things like that,0,0.1352367738043197
2558,And I guess generally I try just to overcome that by basically reaching out to other people like other people on the team or someone else you would maybe not [???] but has experience in the field just to maybe illustrate my thought process see if they see any flaws see if they see maybe a perspective I didn’t think about and then just generally trying to get more viewpoints so that I feel more confident in my own decision or like I reevaluate it to account for things that maybe I didn’t think of before,0,0.07001618768676078
2559,Um so actually that’s one of the things like I’m hoping to figure out …,0,0.23226963873358347
2560,Okay,0,0.2387154408523499
2561,Okay so I guess the job I picked was just to listing like Richard Keppel? Where like they listen to a lot of pitches and they decide like what to fund and I think the reason why I want to should I say why I should or why I want to have that job?,1,0.6100299707868481
2562,Okay so why I should have the job is I think at MIT I’ve gotten a lot of exposure to a lot of different things one is through the breadth of my coursework I guess I’m in two very different fields,0,0.4316075683376617
2563,Another is just through my interaction with people on campus like being on class council being involved in a fraternity I guess I um I’ve seen like a lot of different groups of people,1,0.6100299707868481
2564,And um I guess I’m just constantly around lots of awesome people with awesome ideas and I really enjoy just listening to them,0,0.11320191250810435
2565,And then a lot of the times I’ve helped people to develop maybe they’ve got a gold mine of a plan and I’ve helped them work through especially like sophomores or freshman in the fraternity putting that plan in action,0,0.21611320583280333
2566,SO I think that I would be a good candidate because I’ve had experience listening to ideas I can identify problem areas just because I have a lot of experience executing those ideas,0,0.1352367738043197
2567,So I can both see what might be a good idea technically as well as to see if there’s a good plan to set forth an action and get it done,0,0.21611320583280333
2568,Thank you,1,0.9723827022850665
2569,Umm like where I'm from that type of stuff? Okay umm I'm Junior M,0,0.4716025486650735
2570,I come from South Florida born and raised so cold weather's kind of rough for a guy like me but that's alright,0,0.35729155202333646
2571,It's kind of a nice break from the heat of South Florida,0,0.2115156921086478
2572,Umm I've been playing music ever since I was four so that's kind of been a big part of my life,0,0.3022838906250506
2573,Umm but music tech I mean technology honestly also so umm,0,0.12805425526188313
2574,Course two here which is Mechanical Engineering um but I'm also dabbling in Electrical looking along for sides of control that type of stuff,0,0.09444753853762607
2575,Robotics if you will,0,0.2903869332990904
2576,And just had one of my my second or third robot finished last week which was a freakin' nightmare,0,0.04151446662050083
2577,But you know it's ok it's done it was it was a good time so yeah,0,0.16870585012516354
2578,That's that's what I do,0,0.3022838906250506
2579,Yeah umm I guess that's,0,0.4316075683376617
2580,Yeah alright,0,0.2387154408523499
2581,Yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
2582,Leadership? Um Well I guess I'm uh usually pretty calm and collected so if I ever notice like in a group setting if someone's like you know there's there's disagreement between the two like in my robotics group for example,0,0.4588075285625812
2583,The two guys they're best buds but they often like just get really heated like you know I eff you why why don't we just do this and that type of stuff,0,0.4447099074155249
2584,So,0,0.07018898356424853
2585,In order to like keep it going and being productive someone has to be like you know just guys just calm down and keep doing it so that's that's like just here and there,0,0.16870585012516354
2586,Not really super-like I'm in control you know at least saying guys we need to calm down and take a step forward,0,0.3842912264835878
2587,I feel like that's a little minor leadership role I've got to take there,1,0.7642480901805394
2588,Um other leadership roles um I I play in a group like a band jazz group so I often you know we all got to get together and like kind of talk,0,0.3625540296374043
2589,Any any group setting in which I'm often in I have to like somebody has to take control and I don't often take control initially but you know if something is not going in a certain direction or the right direction I often feel like maybe I can push it there very subtly,0,0.32951325534129816
2590,So leadership in a very subtle way but not in a like a bam I'm telling you what to do,0,0.21899413203219753
2591,That's that's what I like doing,0,0.4716025486650735
2592,Um okay so for example the robotics group um we worked very last minute and just having to be one of those things where we were all busy with other things and we didn't really think about the scheduling like when it was actually when the project was actually going to be due,0,0.37760135231850744
2593,So um basically we all had to work really hard last minute and of course you know things don't always go according to plan so we like we tried to build one thing and machine something and it ended up not being perfect the first time so we have to go back and redesign it or re-machine it so uh we had to re-machine a few things a couple times,0,0.04320927396406251
2594,And you know it's like six in the morning and you've been working in the lab for like thirteen hours and you've got to keep going so you've got to stay positive and keep and you know even though you may not finish or like you know you kind of you can't really think about not finishing,0,0.10759900950079046
2595,You just have to go for it keep finishing keep working eventually you're good with the mind set that you are going to finish,0,0.2886839945882999
2596,So that's uh adversity in that way,0,0.030395260313939607
2597,Just you know always stay positive and keep looking towards the future keep working,0,0.45741044182905144
2598,So um time-management um is one of my weaknesses which is not always the best to admit in an interview but you know whatever uh that's alright,0,0.10429856273872934
2599,What I've been doing to get better about it is you know sometimes you've got to look like even a week in advance I've discovered especially at M,0,0.40018038941567624
2600,isn't as far as you need to go,0,0.2903869332990904
2601,So like this this week for instance I had like three like a final robot project another presentation I had to take care of and you know a lab a couple P-sets,0,0.21899413203219753
2602,Like you just I didn't realize how much work was coming up until like last Thursday or something like that which is when I started working but even then you know I didn't have enough time,1,0.5380555749984539
2603,I really should have started working you know Monday on it when I was just relaxing and was like Oh you know,1,0.5121648375477725
2604,I've got P-sets to do this week but I can really relax and it will be all right,0,0.13113956182223993
2605,So uh in terms of improving that just I you know got to work write up a schedule and look really far in advance make sure I really see what's coming,0,0.08679865998235442
2606,Yeah so I've been trying I've been being better,0,0.4716025486650735
2607,It started off I started college like I didn't see things for like three days in advance two days in advance,0,0.4716025486650735
2608,Now it's kind of like a week week and a half I'm looking in advance,0,0.4716025486650735
2609,I'm getting there slowly but surely,0,0.08380780208344905
2610,Yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
2611,Okay,0,0.2387154408523499
2612,Uh yeah sure,0,0.2387154408523499
2613,For that job you mean?,0,0.2903869332990904
2614,Umm I feel like I know what I'm doing now,1,0.6100299707868481
2615,Um I'll say there was a point in time where I didn't feel like I knew what I was doing and I've been one of those guys that like you know you can apply to a job and say you know yeah there's no harm in applying which I've kind of figured out eventually yeah there is no harm in applying I agree,0,0.4588075285625812
2616,But at the same time I feel like there's kind of like a an obligation to actually know what you're doing for that job and right now I feel like I know what I'm doing,0,0.14280139447180404
2617,At least a lot more so than I did last year or even last semester so at the rate I'm going I feel like you know another semester of classes that I'm taking I'll really know what I'm doing and then some more time in the field or at the job it'll piece together and I'll actually feel pretty confident,0,0.14280139447180404
2618,So that's,0,0.07018898356424853
2619,That's why I guess,0,0.4316075683376617
2620,Yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
2621,Um so I’m a junior at MIT here and um I’m a physics major and I uh yeah besides classes I’m involved in the juggling club and uh let’s see and I’m from Pensacola Florida and I’ve lived there uh ever since I I was born there grew up there and I um yeah lived there and moved up here,0,0.09444753853762607
2622,Yeah I’m in Zeta Psy fraternity and uh yeah so yeah right above Chicago Pizza,0,0.1768600974688769
2623,And uh yeah do you want me to go into more detail or just general? Yeah um yeah so I uh I don’t too much as far as extra-curricular but I was involved with Frisbee freshman year for a little bit and played the club team there’s not a varsity team here,0,0.22001190438092705
2624,I was pretty good liked that a lot,1,0.5724056014340263
2625,And uh I’m not sure as far as career wise what I want to go into but as a physics major I’m looking into something technical probably electrical engineering related,0,0.21611320583280333
2626,Uh and yeah but I’m trying to size that up right now,0,0.1768600974688769
2627,Junior’s a pretty pivotal year for you know deciding long term things,0,0.45741044182905144
2628,Yeah so brief summary of me,0,0.2387154408523499
2629,Um well high school uh senior year probably the best time,0,0.45321313756248316
2630,I helped organize a math competition um so there was no major middle school math competition in Pensacola Florida and so I just teamed up with a few people with my year in high school and we helped organize a competition,1,0.7451478071734184
2631,It’s been going on for the past three years and uh hopefully it’ll go further,0,0.2387154408523499
2632,That was one of the most stressful things but the most rewarding as well and yeah so as far as leadership goes,0,0.060661407047331486
2633,I mean more recently I guess juggling club has been my main leadership thing we organize different gigs and perform various places so,1,0.7132693244092474
2634,Um so that would most commonly have been this past semester I took junior lab which is the physics lab class,0,0.3022838906250506
2635,Lots of challenges frequently,0,0.2869118389241647
2636,It was me and a partner who worked on three different experiments and um specifically I guess let me think because yeah we had three major experiments and the second experiment was very hands on which was cool but it also means there was a lot of faulty equipment,0,0.19821442239249298
2637,I guess just a general thing we both learned to kind of talk it through because it’s so easy to I don’t know get like get in your head and you’re working with somebody so they’ll be thinking one thing and you’ll be thinking another,1,0.8699230625507159
2638,Yeah I guess that’s not very specific but I mean yeah that’s the first thing that came to mind so,0,0.15455013832531528
2639,Yeah weakness? I guess I uh as far as this is kind of a general thing that I’ve kind of come to the realization of recently,0,0.39521743774958146
2640,I need to um I don’t know I’ve been kind of getting along with my undergraduate career and you know what I’ll do after,1,0.5395318149680698
2641,Self-advocacy is like a huge thing and I haven’t really gotten too much into that but I feel like a major thing for like taking the next step like after graduation is like self-advocacy,0,0.11320191250810435
2642,Whether it’s like having your own website or just like general networking,0,0.45741044182905144
2643,I don’t know that’s something that I realize that I need to kind of work on,1,0.6490718829987913
2644,Um yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
2645,Why do I think I should have this job?,0,0.2531596657071087
2646,Um I feel like I’m a pretty creative person and you know having a bit of technical background here and a good work ethic I feel like I really do have those strengths,0,0.4089857459496999
2647,Yeah I feel like I communicate pretty well for um I’m not saying you know general physics majors can’t communicate well just in general I feel like especially this past semester I’ve taken a lab classes I’ve been able to give a lot of oral presentations and um I kind of found a strength there and so I think kind of bringing a solid communication element to a technical field is pretty important,0,0.32951325534129816
2648,So um yeah I feel I’m pretty qualified there,0,0.27356360199342006
2649,Umm so I’m a computer science and biology major here at MIT,0,0.3022838906250506
2650,I’m a junior and I’m expecting to graduate in June 2014,0,0.4730831849790573
2651,Ahm I’m interested in kinda doing both research and as well as practical application of some type of biological research with computational engineering involved,0,0.4716025486650735
2652,Sorry would you like to know more or is that alright?,1,0.9467424494340598
2653,Uhm I do I would say that when situations present themselves I step up to the occasion,0,0.3022838906250506
2654,I’m not afraid to take the lead on a project or like,0,0.35729155202333646
2655,For example I guess um for one of my computer science projects that we were working on a group together one of our teammates wasn’t working well I wasn’t afraid to kind of step up and take the lead and be like “hey we gotta get this done,1,0.5066404005866445
2656,” And um it’s kind of happened multiple times before I guess,0,0.4316075683376617
2657,Um so one of the other organizations I do is Camp Kesem and I’m actually on their exec board,0,0.12805425526188313
2658,And so a lot of what we do is we plan out the summer camp for our kids whose parents have cancer,0,0.04721556736134647
2659,And a lot of times we’re just debating simply like how exactly we want to get uh or how we want the whole camp to you know uh kinda go day by day we need plan out the whole schedule,0,0.2428917736095061
2660,So we have a lot of conflict because everyone has all these different ideas and this is a very team oriented board and although it’s got the normal hierarchal structure uh we do a lot of things like just simply by like mapping them out on the board and visualizing the day and schedules and planning between us and what the teens have to do where we’re able to come up with a solution together,0,0.0926304816353907
2661,So I would say that it’s a good example of me being one of a team and coming up with a solution together,0,0.1768600974688769
2662,Um I think I’d like to be more interested in academia and even research,1,0.6100299707868481
2663,Uh I enjoy what I do but I’ve seen some awesome things that you can do if you-I don’t fault them for pursing a career in peer research which is why I think it’s kind of interesting why I’d admire myself more if I were more interested in that field but -,0,0.16949659631330274
2664,Ah I think I’m qualified and I think I’ll bring a lot to the company I-I fit in well with the environment here,1,0.6100299707868481
2665,And uh it’s something that I’ve always wanted to do,0,0.09444753853762607
2666,Alright,0,0.2387154408523499
2667,Um so um I’m a third-year student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology uh my major is aerospace engineering; and I um… my my background is primarily in fluid mechanics and control and so that’s why I’m interviewing for this position,0,0.3022838906250506
2668,Um and um the applications I’m primarily interested in are in rotorcraft uh design and uh analysis,0,0.3022838906250506
2669,And uh um and I’m really excited about what your company is doing,0,0.08679865998235442
2670,Um so yes,0,0.2387154408523499
2671,I think I I think that I… I don’t think that a leader is the first adjective I’d pull out to describe myself,1,0.6114423030620092
2672,Um but I think it’s something that I definitely a role I definitely step into um when when the need arises or when um I think that it’s appropriate,1,0.6100299707868481
2673,Um whether I seek that out I think really depends on the context but um I definitely see myself as someone who can act independently uh can make decisions independently can act on those decisions and uh can manage people in order um to get sort of positive results,0,0.11320191250810435
2674,Mm-hmm,0,0.2387154408523499
2675,OK um so um… so when I worked for um the computer science and artificial intelligence lab in freshman year I um had had an issue um with one of the students I was working with um um and we had a disagreement about how to handle some part of the project,0,0.3694476305055536
2676,Um it was it was more of a mechanical issue about what direction we should take um and without getting too into details I think um going back to the leadership issue um the way I the way I handled this issue was um to sit down and address the issue very directly um and to have a frank conversation about what we both wanted evaluate where we both were and uh talk through the options and make a decision right there,1,0.5066404005866445
2677,Not letting an issue linger; um I think that’s generally my style,0,0.2397396965153384
2678,Um that’s not a question I’ve been asked a lot,0,0.3022838906250506
2679,I think there are a few things,1,0.532476616497347
2680,Um one that comes to mind immediately is my written communication skills,0,0.3022838906250506
2681,Um I definitely know that’s something that I need to work on and um would love the opportunity to improve on that,0,0.4716025486650735
2682,So from what I’ve seen so far in the interview and visiting um I’m really excited about this position I think this is somewhere I would fit where I would fit in a lot,0,0.11320191250810435
2683,Um I’m really excited about what I would be doing and the people I would be working with and um I would just love to sort of get my hands dirty,0,0.02935760559696661
2684,And um I think I’m pretty well-equipped to do so and to contribute in doing so,0,0.27356360199342006
2685,Um so I’d love that opportunity,0,0.4716025486650735
2686,Yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
2687,Thank you,1,0.9723827022850665
2688,Um so I am a student here at MIT,0,0.3022838906250506
2689,I'm a junior studying biology and management,0,0.3938730607112474
2690,Um I am very interested in finance specifically investment banking or consulting,0,0.3022838906250506
2691,Uh I've taken a bunch of different management finance classes as well as interned in business management,0,0.4716025486650735
2692,uh I've also done laboratory research and I'm working in a small consulting firm part time,0,0.3022838906250506
2693,As as of now so,0,0.2387154408523499
2694,Um I think I'm a leader I think I know how to command respect in certain situations,1,0.6100299707868481
2695,Um I know how to work together on a team I think that's very important uh especially in the positions that I'm working at I think working with a group of people being able to encourage them uh to work towards a certain goal uh shows my leadership characteristics,1,0.6100299707868481
2696,Um I defiantly consider myself a team player,0,0.15248303418968046
2697,I think a lot of the different internships and experiences I've had have forced me to work on a team,1,0.7642480901805394
2698,Um specifically uh in the class that I'm taking right now uh 5279 which is management communication we are working on a team project together and we,1,0.5852163666581659
2699,when deciding on our topic uh for the team project we had a lot of different disagreements a lot of people had different ideas uh and I think I kind of forced people to look at what they were saying versus just like splurting out ideas focusing on how their idea would actually turn out in a presentation,0,0.4560009826490152
2700,Um and so trying to get people to compromise um and in the end we ended up picking my idea so,0,0.14153925129016182
2701,Uh well I think I'd like to be taller that kind of thing (laughs),1,0.6100299707868481
2702,but other than that uh I think I wish I was more outgoing in certain situations,0,0.15455013832531528
2703,Um I think sometimes I'm more reserved or in class I'm a little hesitant to participate if I'm not sure I'm a hundred percent correct,0,0.3937983692193587
2704,I think its kind of a MIT mentality everyone likes to be right all the time,1,0.7011590230711708
2705,So I think uh I have less reser,0,0.15455013832531528
2706,er if I had less reservations about like answering questions that would be great,0,0.4716025486650735
2707,Um I think with my academic experience as well as my internship experiences I have enough uh past um data now assessing quantitative work as well as communication skills and leadership experience um and I have a nice balance of skills going into the position,1,0.6100299707868481
2708,And I am a fast learner,0,0.1768600974688769
2709,I'm willing to learn on the job so I think the combination of all that would be good,0,0.43832997198318147
2710,Yea so Im a member clinical engineering student at MIT I'm a Junior um my main focus is in robotics and product design so I'm real interested in personal robotics and robotic side helps people on a daily basis,0,0.4730831849790573
2711,Um yea I do think I'm a leader um,0,0.4316075683376617
2712,why I'm a leader um I think that I'm very good at communicating with people and allowing people to be able to do something as a group together so somewhat facilitate in communication between others as well as communicating myself to others um and that way and also being able to motivate people and make sure they are on track with whatever they need to do in that way um I think to some extent um people can look up to me in terms of you know what I've done in the past with education or other other things like that,0,0.4767996496271595
2713,Ok yea so I do consider myself a team player I'm currently in a robotics class right now that's a team project based and its me and 3 other students and we recently had to decide on a design for a robot and there is a little bit of not not like total you know people not agreeing but there we had to decide between 2 main 2 different designs and there's a little bit of friction between 2 people versus 2 people of the 4 person team and we need to decide on the majority so um being a team player we were able to kind of mix the 2 designs to a certain extent so that we can all agree on one and i think by being a team leader or team player um excuse me I was able to compromise to some extent or give my ideas on how we can combine the two,1,0.7740913862302434
2714,Ah I think if I could change one thing about myself,0,0.4316075683376617
2715,in terms like personality I assume you mean um I probably,1,0.8088170427287866
2716,that's a hard questions,0,0.11521478613197428
2717,I probably change the fact that I feel like I need to be constantly doing everything at once so I think sometimes I need to focus on one thing other than another cause I do have a really large variety of interest and I wish I had some way to not so I'd get rid of those interests but recognize that I do need to focus out on one thing or one task at one time instead of doing everything at once,0,0.20919740887807237
2718,Ah I think I could be really a beneficial part of adding to your company and it would give me a good opportunity to learn from the people that you guys have currently employed um so if I was given that opportunity both learn from them but also that I'd give benefit to what you guys are doing I think would be great,0,0.4089857459496999
2719,Um I'm a junior at MIT studying electrical engineering and computer science,0,0.3022838906250506
2720,Uh yes,0,0.2387154408523499
2721,I've had several experiences where I've had to innovate and work with take charge of a project and work with other people,1,0.6490718829987913
2722,For instance I'm part of the MIT SAE team and basically it's a club that builds a race car every year,0,0.3022838906250506
2723,Um and as of so we need a lot of money for sponsorship,0,0.33141366362000685
2724,But as of the end of last year the website was pretty much defunct,0,0.060661407047331486
2725,So I decided to take over as webmaster and one of my and over the summer and the beginning of the school year,0,0.09444753853762607
2726,I set up a new one that's nicely designed and to get it up I had to work with most of the other sub-team leaders to get information that I needed,1,0.6490718829987913
2727,For instance the specs of the car pictures of the car different events for PR and things like that,0,0.39245568688584626
2728,And it's done now so it's online now,0,0.07018898356424853
2729,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
2730,So,0,0.07018898356424853
2731,Ah yes because,0,0.2387154408523499
2732,Uh for instance I'm also on the (inaudible),0,0.15248303418968046
2733,And um while I was working on designing the website I talked to several other people including the public relations chair about how to design and present ourselves on the website,0,0.14153925129016182
2734,And we disagreed about certain uh about the layout and things like that,0,0.0926304816353907
2735,So to resolve the issue we basically looked at websites of several other successful teams and tried to we basically both compromised to try to emulate things that seemed to work well for other people,0,0.0926304816353907
2736,And we also got opinions from several other team members,0,0.1066093052570166
2737,Um one thing right now is that I get hung up on small details on a project,0,0.2704138274778955
2738,And that could be an issue when I'm working on a big project it can take too much time to focus on little things that don't matter too much in the big picture,0,0.04151446662050083
2739,But I'm working on changing that so since I've come to MIT I've been involved in a lot of activities and a lot of classes and this is forcing me to manage my time well so I've gotten better at focusing on the big picture of the project rather than small details that don't matter very much,0,0.3635965128388753
2740,I have the quantitative and qualitative skills to solve problems and get things done and I'm really interested in this position and I think I can learn and grow from it,0,0.18134516056488517
2741,Sure,0,0.2387154408523499
2742,Uh,0,0.2387154408523499
2743,I'm a computer science student here and I'm currently a junior but I'm planning on graduating early,0,0.17772661287718336
2744,So uhm I'm right now looking into either getting my master's degree or looking at full time jobs as well and balancing that,0,0.1768600974688769
2745,Uh in terms of what I enjoy in computer science I really like front end stuff,0,0.23226963873358347
2746,I've done a lot of web development,0,0.3938730607112474
2747,I worked at Google last Summer,1,0.5724056014340263
2748,On Google+ photos the front end for that,0,0.2387154408523499
2749,And uh yeah,0,0.07018898356424853
2750,So I really like eh c-consumer facing products,0,0.06788794010145202
2751,Uh well I think I have a pretty engaging personality,1,0.6100299707868481
2752,So I'm very expressive and I'm good at communicating things,0,0.1768600974688769
2753,So I think y'know just that qualification in itself really lends m- my uh myself to leadership,0,0.1137996573992001
2754,But I think also uh as a technical person it's it's e- especially useful to have those skills because they are more rare,0,0.27356360199342006
2755,So in that sense I do think I'm a leader because I possess both you know technical skills and then also the ability to communicate really well,0,0.14280139447180404
2756,So the pairing of that really does lend itself well to leadership roles,0,0.05007391579932511
2757,Sure,0,0.2387154408523499
2758,So eh what's so great about MIT is that we actually do a lot of group projects that really encourage teamwork,0,0.07692020109018043
2759,So you know a lot of the issues that maybe I didn't work out in high school in terms of working on a team I've gotten the chance to flesh out here and I do think that I've been able to grow uhm as someone working on a team,0,0.16949659631330274
2760,So for example in one of my classes it's a software design class and we basically had to split up the work so that we could get this huge project done,0,0.12361406746916685
2761,And one of the people on my team was just really not pulling her weight,0,0.03414728906078335
2762,And so me and this other person noticed this and we were concerned,0,0.04721556736134647
2763,But we all discussed it,0,0.1066093052570166
2764,We sat down and discussed it and we realized just that the way we were allocating the work wasn't playing to her strengths,1,0.5052336361306978
2765,So we adjusted how we were allocating the work and then things worked out a lot better,0,0.19732153176187164
2766,We were able to you know accomplish our goals and also more evenly divide the- the work,1,0.5713018750224388
2767,Uhm that's a hard question,0,0.11521478613197428
2768,Haha!,0,0.2387154408523499
2769,Cuz I'm a pretty confident person so there's not a lot of things,0,0.4716025486650735
2770,I don't often think about this,1,0.532476616497347
2771,I guess,1,0.532476616497347
2772,I wish that uhm,0,0.3938730607112474
2773,I wish I had the ability to uh I guess stop and enjoy the moment a little bit more,1,0.7642480901805394
2774,I think because I am very ambitious and I really enjoy life I'm always going and moving and doing things and I think there's times where it is better to just relax and enjoy whatever's happening in your life,0,0.25663342630896147
2775,Uh but you know I'm young so I like to try a lot of new things,1,0.5380555749984539
2776,And that's a consequence of that,0,0.07018898356424853
2777,Mhmm,0,0.2387154408523499
2778,Uh so I mentioned this before but I think I'm qualified in a lot of respects both technically and in my communication skills,0,0.27356360199342006
2779,So that's just a balance that you don't see a lot uh especially in the computer science field,0,0.08967900877249617
2780,So I think I can bring a lot to the table in terms of that uh in terms of just leadership skills and my ability to talk to people but also my ability to understand uh technical concepts,0,0.15455013832531528
2781,And especially working in a technical company that's incredibly important,0,0.13457995866975905
2782,So I think I have a good balance of that and you're not going to find a lot of candidates like that,0,0.32951325534129816
2783,More about my background? Uh are we assuming that--,0,0.4064865837293959
2784,Okay,0,0.2387154408523499
2785,Okay,0,0.2387154408523499
2786,Um all right,0,0.39245568688584626
2787,Um so I guess I'll start out with uh I decided to go to MIT as my undergrad school,0,0.4316075683376617
2788,Because I wanted a strong education in science and math,0,0.4716025486650735
2789,And um MIT I found would be one of the best places to develop my problem-solving skills and my uh quant--my quantitative skills which is really valuable I feel um for employers nowadays and so I can certainly say that [laugh] it's I have definitely got a lot better at like learning how to solve problems working with others um and it's also given me like a lot of opportunity MIT has given me a lot of opportunity to you know test out my leadership skills by having so many different student groups,0,0.06470480981479461
2790,Um in particular um I've like I feel that um my position as the 2014 treasurer my freshman year was uh really critical in helping me develop um you know time management skills interpersonal skills--,0,0.22322479893436015
2791,--and communicating with like not only your like not only with like um people who are at you know adults who are older than you and working with people in different offices but also with like your peers,0,0.45741044182905144
2792,Um similarly um in training students club I've found um that where I've taken a leadership role as a cultural chair that unlike in say high school you need to really spearhead um efforts to like throw large events yourself and that's like it's really given me um a feel of what it's like to sort of you know take on the responsibility of like organizing an event,0,0.33626012320086685
2793,Mm-hm,0,0.2387154408523499
2794,Um I think I def-- um,0,0.4316075683376617
2795,I'm sorry,1,0.741340820829141
2796,I think that I am definitely a leader,1,0.6114423030620092
2797,As I've I've shared with you previously I um have taken um positions with great responsibility in the student groups I'm involved in and as well in my major I uh am I am inv-- uh I'm in biological engineering and I think that I've taken a lot of initiative in finding you know ways to like test out the concepts I learn in class outside of class by finding uh research positions and later lab um where the weekly lab meetings has really helped me you know improve my communication skills with presenting information to an audience,0,0.14280139447180404
2798,Mm-hm,0,0.2387154408523499
2799,Okay,0,0.2387154408523499
2800,Um I think probably the best example um I definitely consider myself a team player,1,0.6100299707868481
2801,I had to work in teams--in everything I've had to do so far from academics to my work experience,1,0.6490718829987913
2802,Um in my start-up internship my freshman year um and my corporate internship my sophomore year,0,0.3022838906250506
2803,Um everything was I had to learn how to um not only do the task that was given to me but to also sort of be able to you know delegate tasks to who I was working with and carry out what was what was asked of me as well,1,0.5380555749984539
2804,Um last summer I was a year um I did an international year off in Thailand and my lab partner um was a graduate student who was older than me but I was we were partners on the project--,0,0.14153925129016182
2805,--but we found that our levels of technical skill were really different,0,0.2571389984462586
2806,It was her first time working in any sort of lab--,0,0.2387154408523499
2807,--whereas I was more experienced,0,0.3022838906250506
2808,So that sort of created a strange dynamic between us um because I had to like take the lead even though she was given more responsibility because more was expected from her so I had to sort of help her out and get her up to speed with with the project,0,0.12361406746916685
2809,Um and I needed to do that in a way that didn't hurt our personal relationship--,0,0.221435459245776
2810,--because we also did have to like live together,1,0.5052336361306978
2811,Being Americans abroad we really stayed together for most of it so I felt that being just like really honest and transparent with her was um the best way um just to like say what about you know say you know just like speak up about our frustrations but also like to to compliment on like the things that are done well,0,0.312375939653093
2812,I think that's what really helped,0,0.4429978114195979
2813,Um so one thing I wish I was better at was um you know speaking well when put on the spot,1,0.5380555749984539
2814,[Laugh] I tend to when I'm nervous I tend to you know not really focus on what I'm saying because I'm trying not to mess up--,0,0.07372320137026721
2815,--and in order to hide that I also you know channel the stress in different ways such as like looking around perhaps a lot of intrusive movement with my hands or my body um and also speaking being long-winded and speaking too much in order to cover that up,0,0.3829632284737189
2816,So I think that just being more comfortable with speaking um in the higher pressure situation such as public speaking or in an interview! [Laughs],0,0.27356360199342006
2817,Um is something that I would like to improve,0,0.4716025486650735
2818,Okay,0,0.2387154408523499
2819,Um so I think that I can bring like with the the my skills and experience is um someone who is really can work well under stress,0,0.1804648747309403
2820,I may not talk well under stress-- [laughs],1,0.6320398211835518
2821,--but I can work well under stress,0,0.2704138274778955
2822,Um I think my academic being um you know having the rigorous undergraduate curriculum at MIT has made me really hone my time management skills,0,0.25145009326189127
2823,Um the other week I had to juggle um um you know throwing together a large event for a student's club um and have meetings with cultural chairs of the other clubs,0,0.3611869277514505
2824,Um I've also had to at the same time there was a big event that my sorority was organizing that I also have to help contribute to,0,0.3022838906250506
2825,And like uh my I had a friend who's also going through a tough time so I had to like help her out,0,0.1768600974688769
2826,That and then complete school work,0,0.39245568688584626
2827,And also um you know just keep on the lookout now that I'm a junior there's a lot of like you know opportunities and needs such as like fellowships and then like programs of like IP over the summer that have like application deadlines coming up--,0,0.21899413203219753
2828,--and just being able to balance all of that,0,0.2387154408523499
2829,Um and so far um I think that like my experiences um that I was able to be on top of all of those deadlines,1,0.6100299707868481
2830,Not only now but like in the past and I think that says a lot about um my ability to you know work hard and also you know balance out my lifestyle,0,0.4588075285625812
2831,So um I think that this would be a huge asset at your company,0,0.19261288316730724
2832,Umm so I'm a Junior at MIT umm studying economics umm and planning on minoring in biology perhaps concentrating in anthropology,0,0.3572911640991484
2833,Umm I'm interested in pursuing a degree in Public Health after right after MIT umm and either waiting to do an MD or combining those two at the same time,0,0.4716025486650735
2834,Umm what I'm really interested is health care disparities umm especially in in the field of international health umm specifically kind of doing uh cost evaluation of different health projects umm working towards uh figuring out how resources can best be allocated and best be used to maximize efficiency,0,0.1189851931334644
2835,Umm and then here at MIT I'm also involved in an organization called Glommid umm and we what we do is we're partnered with an organization in Togo umm and they work with HIV/AIDS patients there and they are the primary HIV/AID care provider umm outside of the public health system there,0,0.25353811833686407
2836,Umm and so what we do is we fundraise for them throughout the year and then in the summer we go and implement a project there,0,0.33141366362000685
2837,Umm I think that definitely over the MIT my MIT career I've evolved more as a leader,0,0.4316075683376617
2838,Umm of the umm actually the co-president of Glommid umm last year so the club started last year uh but the presidents were not very invested in the club umm and what I learned from that was I guess the experience was taught me some things what leaders shouldn't be but I think really I've learned whats effective as a leader so far by doing things differently this semester,0,0.34651595146154224
2839,Um some of the things like even just the really little basic things seem to really have an impact so for example for our staff meetings which is the whole general body meeting umm we're sending we send out a little doodle form beforehand and it kinda just has you know what concerns do you have umm do you feel like you're really involved like umm and there's also just a little section like kudos to someone for doing a great job this week,0,0.07334689120645153
2840,And just having that like interaction and then also we like follow up on any concerns umm I think the members really have liked that and so far compared to last year everyone like even the people who are just general body members not even like an exec are much more invested than some of the exec members last year and I think thats because we realized last year what we really were lacking umm like my current co-president realized that what we were lacking was really a sense of community and in order to be effective and to really establish a strong relationship with our partner and to fundraise and really come up with a strong project we need to focus within ourselves first,0,0.07732075106804231
2841,Umm so that experience definitely has taught me a lot about leadership,0,0.2387154408523499
2842,Umm yea ok,0,0.2387154408523499
2843,So conflict,0,0.030395260313939607
2844,Umm well i guess I'll use an example from last year for Glommid,1,0.6100299707868481
2845,Umm so we were partnered with a different organization last year and we what how it works is a national organization theres fifty chapters umm and we had a partner in Laos and all of a sudden last minute they said we could no longer go and implement the project,0,0.19732153176187164
2846,So I was the person in charge of organizing the trip that my role on exec so that was really hard for me because I felt kind of betrayed kind of by the co-presidents and by nationals umm because the reason was because the Laotian government would see us volunteer tourism and they could get their NGO status revoked since Laos just started having NGO's,0,0.03908854498635575
2847,So that was something I kind of was unsure about like are we sure we can go here like Laos is very not welcoming towards Americans because of past,0,0.12361406746916685
2848,And so I felt really kind of let down by umm by them,0,0.058349808998298384
2849,And I think everyone on the Glommid team also felt really let down because it was February we had been fundraising all year planning campaigns umm and this so what we did I think umm like I switched over to campaigns coordinator and I still like tried to keep everyone invested and excited for our campaign to still fundraise for them because it wasn't because they were a bad organization that we couldn't go it was because that the government wouldn't allow it and we didn't want to risk them losing their NGO status for a project,0,0.07732075106804231
2850,Umm so what I went through the campaign I tried to get people to focus more just remember what our partner does why we are doing this umm and not focus so much on kind of the miscommunication that happened between nationals and the partner organization,0,0.4064865837293959
2851,Umm and then through this summer and through this fall i've been trying to keep in contact with our partner our old partner although we are repartnered now umm to see how our the money we raised like how that project is going and to try and keep people informed about what's going on so that it doesn't feel like last year was a complete failure,1,0.5066404005866445
2852,Yea,0,0.2387154408523499
2853,Oh thats a tough question,0,0.39245568688584626
2854,Umm I think sometimes i can lack a bit of confidence in bigger group settings,0,0.3937983692193587
2855,Umm and it usually takes me a little bit to get comfortable with the situation so I think I've definitely and this is something i've been working on to be more proactive and in larger group situations but for example like big lectures asking questions or things like that I usually try and avoid but I've been trying to push myself to become more vocal,1,0.6100299707868481
2856,Uh I think I should get the job because I think what my assets are I combine Econ and health which is kind of rare to have as an undergraduate to have this combination,0,0.4316075683376617
2857,And I've done I've taken a lot of classes I'm involved in a national development both from the technical side of Econ the anthropological and the health side,0,0.09444753853762607
2858,And also my involvement in Glommid has also taught me a lot about the realities of international health and international development that I don't think necessarily come through a class,0,0.15455013832531528
2859,Been all right,0,0.39245568688584626
2860,School’s uh you know it’s always that time in the middle of the semester,0,0.2903869332990904
2861,Yeah it’s nuts,0,0.2387154408523499
2862,Um yes so I am a junior here at MIT in Computer Science and Engineering um and most of my experience here has been actually at the Game Lab on campus so I’ve worked there for the past few years and I’ve worked on many different kinds of projects in various languages and with different people,0,0.23226963873358347
2863,Um and uh also uh I’ve taken courses here in algorithms uh in graphics uh also software construction,0,0.3022838906250506
2864,But I’ve really found algorithms to be something that I’m really interested in I think they’re really beautiful and elegant they can accomplish a lot,0,0.11320191250810435
2865,And in my spare time I like to um do yoga I’m not very good at it and I love food so finding hidden gems in the city is really fun,0,0.06788794010145202
2866,Uh yes I am,0,0.3022838906250506
2867,So um last semester here at MIT I took as I mentioned a software construction class and um in this class we had you know quite a few projects and some of these were group projects,0,0.21635601920204697
2868,So the first group project that we had in the class um I was working with uh two of my peers,0,0.14153925129016182
2869,They seemed um like nice people and all but we were having issues um you know actually getting things done,0,0.15796148039797941
2870,Getting a time when we could all meet and um you know that sort of thing,0,0.3927973489599513
2871,So uh it looked like no one was really stepping up so I decided to step up and um I made sure to contact everyone in the group and um you know got us working together um and we met up,0,0.13062676423831393
2872,And you know I made sure that we were always on task and took notes on what we were doing um so that when it came to actually implementing our ideas that we actually had some sort of structure and our project turned out really great uh at the end,0,0.13062676423831393
2873,There was a bit of a time crunch but all in all I think we worked together really well and I’m very pleased with how it turned out,0,0.4560009826490152
2874,I do consider myself a team player,0,0.4730831849790573
2875,Um worked on many teams,0,0.39245568688584626
2876,So in this same software construction class ironically the second group project which was our final project for the course did not go quite as planned,0,0.05978464467074935
2877,So I was working with two other people and uh in this case I tried to get us working together and tried to do my part for our project but uh they were not having it and um they actually ended up overwriting my code multiple times instead of you know allowing me to contribute to the project um even after I spoke to them about it and told them there were tools um that could help resolve conflicts in the code and they just weren’t cooperating,0,0.029398459550941756
2878,Um and so I ended up having to go talk to my TA and talking to my course administrator here and also to the student support services to see you know what how I could resolves the situation because I had done everything that I thought I could,1,0.6712110669180035
2879,Um so that turned out okay at the end but sometimes things are out of your control and I think those are the hardest problems to confront but um you know uh it’s okay to ask for help sometimes I think that it ended up okay in the end,0,0.0901395103829997
2880,Ooh that’s a toughie,0,0.2387154408523499
2881,Hmm I think if I had one thing I could change it would probably be being more aggressive which aggressive is a scary word perhaps so um perhaps being more assertive,0,0.2397396965153384
2882,I’ve always been a pretty quiet person um even when I was growing up and this is something that like in elementary school my teachers would say that “Oh” you know on my progress reports “[Stephie?] Is a very quiet and sweet girl” but they didn’t really have anything else to say because I was so quiet,0,0.45000859481168076
2883,Um and you know even now sometimes being around people can make me nervous and this is something that I’ve been working on um you know over you know since I can remember I guess,0,0.29154798900042767
2884,And as of late I’ve been trying to take a more active role in you know overcoming my fear of people,0,0.05350031627826969
2885,Uh I uh a few years ago worked at a Starbucks for about a year,0,0.4716025486650735
2886,Yeah back in this was in downtown Boston in the financial district so of all the customers you could possibly have at a Starbucks these were the probably the most challenging ones that you could have,0,0.17901834688044663
2887,So after working there and dealing with these people I feel like I can pretty much you know I can deal with anyone even if it makes me sort of nervous,0,0.16949659631330274
2888,Um you know I’ve been there so I can sort of take my experiences form there and apply them to what I encounter nowadays,0,0.3611869277514505
2889,Hm well uh I have a lot of experience uh working at the Game Lab here and that coupled with you know what I’ve learned in classes I think makes me a really good fit for this job,0,0.4089857459496999
2890,I have um so when I was working at the Game Lab I worked on many many projects so pretty much one project a semester and these projects varied widely,1,0.6490718829987913
2891,They were in different languages the topics were different,0,0.2387154408523499
2892,Some were more technical some weren’t’,0,0.2387154408523499
2893,Some were more fully specified than others,0,0.2387154408523499
2894,And so given that I’ve touched upon such a wide range of things I think that I’m very adaptable,0,0.27356360199342006
2895,Uh and also um at this Game Lab I’ve worked in lots of teams so I feel like I have a strong grasp of teamwork and having worked at that Starbucks I’ve really learned to deal with all sorts of people so I feel like that’s a good asset to have for this job,0,0.11320191250810435
2896,OK um,0,0.2387154408523499
2897,this is separate from the other time right?,0,0.39245568688584626
2898,OK (laughs) um I'm a junior um at MIT studying environmental engineering,0,0.3022838906250506
2899,Um I'm originally from Minnesota,0,0.3022838906250506
2900,Um I'm taking classes this semester in hydrology and environmental transport and I found them really interesting,0,0.23226963873358347
2901,And I thought that they would apply to this job,0,0.15455013832531528
2902,Um yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
2903,(Laughs),0,0.2387154408523499
2904,Um yeah I think I've stepped up to a lot of leaderslip -ship positions since I came to college,0,0.4316075683376617
2905,I'm president of my living group um I'm also on the rowing team and I feel like I've um played a leadership role there um,1,0.7642480901805394
2906,Um so as president of my living group um I lead house meetings every other week,0,0.4716025486650735
2907,and I also am involved in resolving problems between people um so there's like several different conditions in the house which control like say for instance like buying food or like maintaining the house and I help coordinate everybody and make sure they can work together,0,0.08191717026182452
2908,Mmmhmm,0,0.2387154408523499
2909,Umm,0,0.2387154408523499
2910,yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
2911,Umm let me think,0,0.35466757698507523
2912,I guess something that's come up in my living group I was house manager last semester and so as part of our living group people have to do like weekly house jobs,1,0.8367235883167741
2913,So like kind of chores and so we've definitely had conflicts over like people who aren't pulling their weight in the house and there were times I had to step in and take the person aside and let them know that they were adversely affecting the group and that there were like consequences if they didn't um end up you know pulling more weight and I definitely had success with that and um one particular instance I talked to someone and she came back to the next house meeting and apologized to the group and,0,0.1554588016020326
2914,definitely started to change her behavior,0,0.2387154408523499
2915,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
2916,I don't,0,0.3938730607112474
2917,I don't think there's anything I would necessarily change about myself,1,0.6114423030620092
2918,I feel like the experiences I've had have like taught me different things,1,0.7642480901805394
2919,And um there's definitely things I'm working on growing in,0,0.09444753853762607
2920,But they're things that like I don't think they're things I would expect to change overnight necessarily,0,0.27356360199342006
2921,Um I'm working on being more outgoing so like I said I've stepped up both on the crew team and as part of my living group,0,0.4716025486650735
2922,into leadership roles and so I think that's changed a lot in the last couple of years and is still changing,0,0.15455013832531528
2923,Um I think I have a lot of experience um with the classes I've taken and with previous internship opportunities,0,0.4316075683376617
2924,Um I did an internship at an environment restoration company after my freshman year,0,0.3022838906250506
2925,which I think helped prepare me,1,0.6100299707868481
2926,Um I'm also really excited about going into this field um I haven't b- had the chance to apply the things I've learned in my classes yet and I think this would be a really good opportunity for me to apply those things so,0,0.11320191250810435
2927,I think I would be able to help the company out in that way,1,0.6114423030620092
2928,Okay!So uh I grew up in Tampa Florida uhm from paretns of Chinese-American decent or they're from China and I'm Chinese American and uhm thoughout my uhm high school career I actually uh taking biology classes cuz I had a really good teacher who like really made uh this subject material engaging uhm and then here in MIT I uhm I first started out as Course 20 which us uh biological engineering and then I took my first programming class and I really liked it its like uhm I think it sort of matches uhm how I think like telling a computer how to uh do things in a precise way and so thats why I switched to uh Course 67,0,0.2948729886742195
2929,hmmm mmm,0,0.2387154408523499
2930,uhm I think that I'm a leader in the sense that like oh let's say that there's a thing that needs to get done then I will make sure that it does get done like uh for example at uh the TAC which is MIT student newspaper uhm every week uhm you have to uh of course like edit things and when the previous uhm campus life editor wanted to move on to a different department I stepped up and got it done uhm yeah,1,0.6712110669180035
2931,uhm so I guess when uhm I havent had a super large amount of time to uh experience doing like really large team projects I imagine I'll get more experience in that as I get into like more project based classes uhm I guess I would uh I'm okay with working with other people as long as uh there's like clear communication and like people are responsible like uhm doing the task that they're supposed to be doing,0,0.34651595146154224
2932,I guess I would be good working with a team other like responsible people that make sure like you're doing your portion of the job because I would want to make sure I am also doing my portion of the job and like if everybody like does their part then I think that I would be happy working with them,1,0.8088170427287866
2933,hmmm well actually statistically I think that I would like to be a little but taller because actually it's true I believe that like taller people are more like uhm they get better like jobs and like they're statistically more likely to succeed just because you're more impressed by a taller person so it's like well sure why not? It would I think it would make it might have some percentage chance of making my life better,0,0.14280139447180404
2934,Also if I maybe there's like another second thing changing my last name to something that starts with A because thats also showing statistically increase your chances of success,1,0.5991253810632329
2935,uhm same company okay uhm so I think I hope that uh I have so I would obviously really love working for Google and I would and uhm my skills as being responsible communicating clearly my uh computer science skills I learned at MIT I hope will bring uh a lot of value to this position and I also really uh would I hope to embody Google's principles of like uh making really innovative software and like to build to delivering really good customer experiences uhm and I hope that uh they will uh I hope you will also find my contributions you can find my uh contributions useful,0,0.14280139447180404
2936,I'm a Junior in Aerospace Engineering,0,0.3938730607112474
2937,I'm originally from Kansas City born in Maryland,0,0.3938730607112474
2938,And I'm interested in consulting because I'm currently trying to decide between going into Aerospace Engineering and going into consulting,0,0.09444753853762607
2939,And one of the things that appeals to me about consulting is that I like the idea of working on different projects and not being stuck doing the same thing all the time and that's something that is very prevalent in engineering and is very traditional about the engineering field,0,0.08191717026182452
2940,And as far as hobbies that I enjoy I am interested in global development international development and poverty related issues as well as music,0,0.08191717026182452
2941,I play cello and am involved with the chamber music society at MIT,0,0.3938730607112474
2942,Yes I definitely do think I'm a leader,0,0.4316075683376617
2943,Um one of the global poverty - er - one of the organizations I'm involved with on campus is the Global Poverty Initiative and I'm currently their Director of Action,0,0.15248303418968046
2944,And what that means is I'm leading a student group of about twenty people and - um - under the Action branch of the whole organization - and what we do is - in the Action branch - is work on projects on a global scale,0,0.1316593597667821
2945,So we have projects currently in India and projects in mexico,0,0.1066093052570166
2946,And my job is to coordinate these projects and work on what communities we want to go work in and what types of technology related projects we'd like to pursue,0,0.25353811833686407
2947,And I've been involved with this organization for two and a half years now and have been the director of Action for the past two years,0,0.09444753853762607
2948,I definitely do consider myself a team player,0,0.4730831849790573
2949,Um one time that we experienced some conflict in one of the teams I was working on was actually in one of my Aerospace Engineering classes,0,0.08793220568631051
2950,In this team our job was to build an RC airplane - design build and fly it,0,0.33141366362000685
2951,And we hit some conflicts within our team because - it was mostly everyone was very busy everyone was very stressed,0,0.05978464467074935
2952,It was towards the end of the year when everyone's preparing for finals and it was just a very high-strung environment and the projects was very involved,0,0.2387154408523499
2953,It involved machining it involved design work and coordination between a team of four,0,0.39245568688584626
2954,And what ended up happening was well we needed to get in and find the time to actually work on our airplane and build it,0,0.035864535156242786
2955,Whereas all of us were involved in student groups and had a very heavy courseload,0,0.33141366362000685
2956,And conflict did arise,0,0.030395260313939607
2957,And how we ended up solving this was we - we all decided that something needed to change,0,0.050575491362774505
2958,And we realized that we weren't putting together quality work when we were doing two people at a time or two people coming in or someone cancelling at the last minute - things like that,0,0.19732153176187164
2959,We ended up just having to sit down lay it all out discuss whatever we needed to do to make sure that we're all here - we're all committing the right amount of time towards this project,1,0.5052336361306978
2960,And honestly it was just very much a group effort and we all sat down and individually realized that we needed to prioritize,0,0.03887770666152822
2961,And I needed to put my classes above some of my interests and my hobbies,0,0.1768600974688769
2962,And that was something that we all decided to do as a group,0,0.1066093052570166
2963,One thing about myself,0,0.3022838906250506
2964,being more on top of my work,0,0.4716025486650735
2965,Something that I definitely need for myself is a deadline and I've always been like that,0,0.4716025486650735
2966,If you don't give me a deadline sometimes I'll end up dragging my feet and things get done at the last minute and it's just,0,0.23152446905371948
2967,disorganization,0,0.2387154408523499
2968,And so I've been trying to deal with that by making my own small deadlines - personal deadlines - writing them down making lists and making sure that I prioritize things in advance,0,0.09444753853762607
2969,But that's something that has taken me probably two years at MIT to learn how to do - and I'm finally getting it,0,0.118032441819917
2970,I think I should get the job because I have a very interesting background and I believe that I have very unique experiences that could add a lot to your organization,1,0.8088170427287866
2971,As someone with an engineering background but - as well as a management background because I am minoring in management at MIT,0,0.4716025486650735
2972,And I think that combination adds a lot to the environment that you would like to have at your company,0,0.32951325534129816
2973,I think putting a lot of people together in one environment trying to work on the same projects with the same background is something that is very limiting,1,0.7011590230711708
2974,And I believe that I could add quite a bit of diversity and unique perspective to your team,0,0.14868321799823644
2975,Sure so I'm currently a junior at MIT,0,0.3022838906250506
2976,I grew up outside of the city in a suburb called Naydec,0,0.3938730607112474
2977,I've danced my whole life and continued to do so at MIT and I'm studying biology currently and for my humanities concentration concentrating on Spanish,0,0.4730831849790573
2978,I would say definitely in various aspects of my life I try to step up as a leader,0,0.4730831849790573
2979,I'm currently involved in an internship through HELLO at MIT and so the point of the internship is to act as a peer network engagement intern,0,0.18051115217519223
2980,So basically reaching out to other Jewish students at MIT who may not be looking for a very religious atmosphere,0,0.08830690875445948
2981,But would just like to know that there are other Jewish students that they could connect with,0,0.13457995866975905
2982,And so my role as the leader of the situation is to connect various students who have similar interests either in community service or things like that and sort of set up a network for them,0,0.1768600974688769
2983,Sure I definitely hope that I'm a team player,0,0.3022838906250506
2984,I think,1,0.532476616497347
2985,It's definitely important to have leadership qualities but also to be able to mesh well within a group,0,0.39245568688584626
2986,I think this comes out a lot in lab settings where everyone from undergraduate students to PhD candidates and post Docs really have to work together on similar projects,0,0.4429978114195979
2987,And so being able to voice your opinions or your concerns about experiments while still taking the feedback from others and making it more of a group effort than a hierarchy I would say would be crucial,0,0.05350031627826969
2988,I think if I could change one thing it would probably be to have a little bit more self confidence,1,0.7642480901805394
2989,I think I externally try to project a calm and outgoing personality but inside I can tend to be a little bit shyer,1,0.7642480901805394
2990,And so I think just being able to walk into any kind of either social or business related situation and really have that confidence without having to second guess myself would help move along both career wise and just with relationships with other people,0,0.11320191250810435
2991,I think coming with a background from MIT would definitely help me out in this job,1,0.532476616497347
2992,The biology department at MIT is really unique in its focus on research,0,0.09607975816263775
2993,And so I think coming into this lab setting with that background would make a strong candidate,0,0.27356360199342006
2994,I'm good how are you?,1,0.6359670093958226
2995,Um yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
2996,I am wait sorry am I,1,0.7983862058723772
2997,Ok um I'm Kathleen I'm a Core 16 major here at MITU that's um aeronautical and astronautical engineering if you're not familiar with our numbering system,1,0.6493981547555095
2998,Um so I've been taking a lot of classes in aeronautical and astronautical engineering,0,0.3022838906250506
2999,Including some um propulsion classes um uh principals of automatic control um dynamics aerodynamics um computer engineering so I am familiar with job and mat lab Um and then also within those classes I've done some lab work,0,0.4716025486650735
3000,Um including work on um a remote control airplane,0,0.39245568688584626
3001,Um which we did for a competition last spring,0,0.33141366362000685
3002,Um it was in teams of three,0,0.2387154408523499
3003,Um my team and the the goal is to maximize the ratio of the um the turn rate times the pay turn rate squared times the pay load,0,0.3022838906250506
3004,Um my team worked really hard on that um and uh we ended up coming in second um,0,0.16569992293552951
3005,Which was exciting a little bit disappointing but [laughter] still it was still a really fun project that we worked on,0,0.12568037976852317
3006,Um and then also done internships with um my most recent one was with NASA Glenn Research Center um and I worked on two projects for that,0,0.4716025486650735
3007,Um one was a Venus rover conceptual design,0,0.2387154408523499
3008,Um which was where we were trying to basically just figure out what the fees-ability would be for a small low cost rover on Venus um that would be able to fit within the budget of a discovery class mission,0,0.33141366362000685
3009,Um and then so that one was mostly um there was a lot of research a lot of um pulling the other information from different areas kind of because it's not really a thing that people have looked at very closely before,0,0.12001822993247584
3010,There's not a lot of information on the topic of how things perform in uh 450 degrees C in 90 atmospheres of pressure,0,0.2387154408523499
3011,It's kind of a specific thing,0,0.2387154408523499
3012,Um so it was um a lot of just like trying to figure out like what would work what wouldn't work,0,0.39245568688584626
3013,Um a lot of flexibility in the designs since it was in early stages um and a lot of um there's some some mat lab you know and analysis and um coding involved with that to,0,0.45741044182905144
3014,Um then the second project that we worked on for that internship was um an autonomous navigation system for small payloads um and that was an intern team project,1,0.5052336361306978
3015,There was totally designed and run by me and a group of seven other interns,0,0.2387154408523499
3016,Um so that was outside of work hours,0,0.39245568688584626
3017,We were putting together um it was uh steerable [inaudible] parachute,0,0.17070910373751436
3018,Um attached to a payload of about two or three pounds um and I was in charge of testing and designing the the parachute for that um so that was that was the second main project that we worked on,1,0.5852163666581659
3019,Um yes I do think I'm a leader,0,0.4316075683376617
3020,Um and I think that I've shown that through my work on my projects,1,0.6100299707868481
3021,Um being willing to to make decisions take chances with something um that may or may not work but it's wi,0,0.21418082083390527
3022,it's important to be able to try things to figure out if that's gonna be the case or not,0,0.39245568688584626
3023,Um and I think that uh especially like in the the Venus rover and um also with the dropson project um since those were two projects where there weren't a lot of uh specific design constraints imposed on us from the start,1,0.7120528119563496
3024,It was really important to just um to just take an idea and run with it,0,0.17963402645220658
3025,Run the equations um drop it off a building in the case of the dropson [laughter] um and just see what happened um,0,0.07018898356424853
3026,So that was something that I got to be pretty comfortable with doing,0,0.1768600974688769
3027,Uh yes and yes,0,0.2387154408523499
3028,[laughter] Um I need a so especially with the intern team project when there were eight of us involved in this team um and that was a kind of unique experience in that there was really no like hierarchy of um control or anything it was just eight interns and we were all on equal footing,0,0.3235285561025297
3029,All had pretty equal experience and backgrounds um so there wasn't really anyone who was specifically in charge of that project um and that involved a lot of give and take,0,0.17963402645220658
3030,Um and so I think one of the biggest uh conflicts we faced as a team was when we were just deciding at the very beginning what our project was going to be,0,0.33266185708888013
3031,Um and this was going to be something that was gonna uh be a pretty significant part of the next ten weeks of our summer,1,0.5052336361306978
3032,So it was pretty important for us to choose something that was gonna was gonna go well,0,0.19732153176187164
3033,Um so the it ended up being a uh fairly difficult decision between the uh a design project for uh a small re-entry vehicle versus the autonomous navigation system that we did,0,0.3523851046866215
3034,Um and how we handled it um was we just kind of we all came together and had um a round table sort of a discussion,0,0.33141366362000685
3035,Um we implemented hand raising uh rules,0,0.33141366362000685
3036,and um so as to make sure that people had equal talking time,0,0.07018898356424853
3037,Um and then we after we had talked for several hours um making sure that most of the important things that needed to be said would get said,1,0.5052336361306978
3038,Um we we just voted on it um with secret ballet wrote down what our decision what decision we wanted um we counted up the votes and then we just went with that decision,0,0.1066093052570166
3039,Um and I think that um for me and for the other interns on the team as well it was really important that everyone recognize that whatever the outcome of the vote was was that's what we were gonna do um and we would all get on board with that project right away,0,0.4560009826490152
3040,Um and that's what happened um and there wasn't any like uh real I don't know bitterness or resentment about doing the project that we did,0,0.4677442879977017
3041,I think it pretty well,1,0.7011590230711708
3042,Um I would make it so that I was more organized,0,0.3022838906250506
3043,I often struggle to meet deadlines when I have a lot of them piled together,0,0.3235995787201452
3044,Not because the work is hard but because I just forget that the deadlines are coming,0,0.2704138274778955
3045,Um so I think that that's something that I could really work on um and I have been working on that [laughter] um by keeping notebooks and writing down uh schedules of important dates um asking friends to help me out if I know that there's something we're working on together and it's at the deadline or just an assignment that we both have and there's a deadline,0,0.4560009826490152
3046,Asking for a reminder um from my more talented friends um and keeping my Google calendar up to date as well has been helping with that,0,0.4716025486650735
3047,Um I think I should get this job because I am uh I am well qualified for it,1,0.6100299707868481
3048,I've done projects that are um they are in the same type of area and I think that my experiences from them will really carry over so I can contribute to this job,0,0.34786240899840215
3049,Um and uh I think that I can also um I mean I've also shown that I'm I am a team player and a leader so I think that as well as my technical expertise I think that uh my personality fits in well with this job and I really like the environment as well that I've seen,0,0.11320191250810435
3050,Um um um employees it seems like there's a lot of enthusiasm for work,1,0.5309974197500003
3051,um and I think that I would fit in well with that,1,0.6100299707868481
3052,I'm doing well thank you,1,0.9864801121167501
3053,Um so I'm a jun--wait,0,0.3022838906250506
3054,sorry I don't-- I'm sorry i just uh I'm just confused about like are we--are we going like the same thing last time or do I need to introduce myself again?,1,0.9280362848952939
3055,like,0,0.39245568688584626
3056,Okay okay I got confused 'cause you said tell me more,0,0.26044765762704375
3057,Okay sorry okay I was like wait,1,0.7974282575990507
3058,Am I supposed to,0,0.3572911640991484
3059,okay sorry,1,0.5803657338044622
3060,Um so I am a junior at MIT studying chemistry and biology,0,0.3022838906250506
3061,I'm primarily interested in how small molecules interact with biological systems such as um the effects of drugs or uh toxins or other uh metabolites on the body and its cells,0,0.3938730607112474
3062,I've done research since uh like coming to MIT at in the lab of professor [sounds like] Jonessiben in chemistry and biological engineering,1,0.5724056014340263
3063,I've been looking at the mechanism of a drug that is currently in phase two clinical trials,0,0.3938730607112474
3064,um for treatment of HIV,0,0.2387154408523499
3065,Umm in addition I have also done organic synthesis to develop um spacers for drug delivery um at the Curie Institute in Paris,0,0.3022838906250506
3066,I think I am a leader,1,0.6114423030620092
3067,I've done work in my dorm house government as dining chair and environmental chair to take a leadership role um and help residents to um express their concerns with the dining plan,0,0.43441758665660263
3068,Um and to make changes to help make the residential experience um better for them,0,0.39245568688584626
3069,I definitely consider myself a team player,0,0.4730831849790573
3070,I've uh done a lot of work in teams in my chemistry and undergraduate labs,1,0.6490718829987913
3071,Uh we were often working in groups of like two or three,1,0.5671518808090605
3072,Um there have been conflicts in those situations where um it's difficult,0,0.11521478613197428
3073,like if a team member uh messes up something or even uh before that if team members come to the team with different lab experience due to their research background or classes they've taken before,0,0.2115156921086478
3074,Trying to figure out how to balance it so everyone gets to ex--um do the lab and have hands on experience while at the same time making sure that things go smoothly and that we work in an efficient manor,1,0.5052336361306978
3075,Um so it's,0,0.2387154408523499
3076,it can be difficult to balance these things such that everyone gets a fai-um a fair chance at doing the hands-on component but we generally resolve this by taking turns and the people who are more experienced kind of uh you know supervise in almost a mentor-like way the person who has less experience,0,0.415240651165385
3077,I would-if I could change one thing about myself- it would be to l,0,0.4730831849790573
3078,uh to be able to let go of things that have happened and like negative things that have happened more easily because I find that sometimes I can dwell on negative things that have happened and it causes me to worry a lot about the future and become very anxious or to hinder what I want to do in the future like being concerned,0,0.32230062042973917
3079,you kn,0,0.13115931029929018
3080,being so worried about performance in a class after not doing well on an exam that I get stressed out for the next exam,0,0.2704138274778955
3081,And that can create like a negative cycle so if I could change one thing it would be learning how to put bad things behind me and move ahead,0,0.08191717026182452
3082,It's something I've definitely been working on and having to work on since I can to MIT where you get used to you know a lot of things,1,0.5380555749984539
3083,Not have negative things happen but learning to push through that,0,0.11521478613197428
3084,I think I should get the job because I have experience from my--from my course work which is very rigorous at MIT in addition to my practical experience with research which has taught me what the research process is like how to ask questions how to work independently and to pre--uh to present results and interpret them,1,0.7642480901805394
3085,Umm and that's good skills I think for the work place,1,0.6100299707868481
3086,I'm doing pretty well how are you?,1,0.6359670093958226
3087,Um so as far as my technical experience background goes; um I've worked in three different labs,0,0.4716025486650735
3088,Um the summer after my freshman year I worked in a lab through um through MGH and located in Charleston,0,0.4716025486650735
3089,I worked with a Harvard graduate student on her PH,1,0.5724056014340263
3090,D Thesis which involved a lot of genetics and I did a lot of like very routine lab work,0,0.4716025486650735
3091,Um and that was just for the summer and then the next um my soft-more year I worked in a lab here at MIT um the Engelward laboratory that works with DNA damage and I worked on an essay that quantified DNA damage using um electrophoresis,0,0.2704138274778955
3092,Which was nice because I got to learn a lot of um different laboratory techniques and because I'm still currently working there,0,0.4716025486650735
3093,I've had the time to delve into the project a little bit more have a deeper understanding than I was initially,0,0.4730831849790573
3094,Um and it also incorporates um components of coding like we use the math lab area um to um generate our data so it's been really interesting for me,0,0.2571389984462586
3095,Um and also this past summer I worked in a laboratory in Israel which was really interesting they worked with all sorts of bio-sensors um so it's a pretty broad um field that they worked in; and I got to work on my own project,0,0.23226963873358347
3096,I've never had that type of independent freedom which was really exciting for me,0,0.31213544981287855
3097,Um and I think what I got more out of that was that just getting used to such a different work place and being able to acclimate myself and um be productive in that sort of environment so,1,0.6100299707868481
3098,Um I think I'm definitely a leader I am willing to take charge of a situation um in a group of people,1,0.6100299707868481
3099,I'm not afraid to stand out or have my opinions heard; um and on the flip-side I'm not afraid to suffer consequences if uh there's any sort of negative outcome or negative or positive outcome I'm willing to handle um the results,0,0.43441758665660263
3100,Um I think I'm a team player because I'm willing to agree to others peoples um ideas um the question was a what was sorry could you repeat the,1,0.9772977469136356
3101,Conflict in my team okay,0,0.15248303418968046
3102,Um so I in my sorority I'm on the executive board there's 10 of us and we're lke in charge of the chapter; and so um we've just all been newly elected to or positions so we're kind of going through the process of working out exactly what our goal is,0,0.4064865837293959
3103,And recently one of the topics have been like how to handle um judiciary issues like within our chapter and I have like very strong feelings on the subject as do other of my sisters,0,0.12361406746916685
3104,And so being able to kind of handle that and be very professional and try to be unbiased because um I have like close relations with like other sisters in the chapter has been um a challenge,0,0.1768600974688769
3105,And I think being able to remove myself emotionally from the situation and kind of listen to what the other people are saying and acknowledge that has been really one of the like biggest steps I've taken into kind of overcoming those kinds of challenges,0,0.11320191250810435
3106,Um think all I can think is like superficial things like the ability to sing or something like that,0,0.3937983692193587
3107,Um I would like to be able to think a little bit faster on my feet as I took a very long time to answer that question,1,0.5338463461786015
3108,Um I think I've given time I think I can come up with like good ideas and good responses and like handle issues in a good way,0,0.3937983692193587
3109,Um and I think that just being able to think of something a little bit quicker I know that sometimes there's like times of crisis and it takes me a little bit longer than I would like to be able to um come up with the like ideal solution,0,0.3937983692193587
3110,So that would be one of my things I'd like to change,0,0.1768600974688769
3111,I think I'm able to combat it pretty well by taking steps to you know mitigate the situation like handle it but ultimately that would be one thing I'd like to improve on,1,0.8088170427287866
3112,Um I think I should get the job because I'm a very hard worker and in whatever position I am in I will do it to the best of my ability,0,0.3937983692193587
3113,Um I have experience in a lot of different areas um as I mentioned in my lab experience and I think the aspect that makes me unique from other people looking for this position is my perspective; um I'm able to see a problem pretty unbiasedly and judge what would be the best um solution and also see potential obstacles on the way there and potential outcomes; and so I think that my general overview overview of problems gives me an advantage over other people,0,0.3937983692193587
3114,Hah,0,0.2387154408523499
3115,uh yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
3116,so,0,0.07018898356424853
3117,uhm I'm chase and I guess uh,0,0.15455013832531528
3118,Aww man okay so i've done web development for a long time I started in abotu 8th grade and actually started making a few sites just back then and for the heck of it and uhm just started making some money through them sold a website through them which was great,0,0.02935760559696661
3119,Uhm and through all fo this I got an internship for my sophmore year of high school which was awesome,0,0.4716025486650735
3120,It was through a job search website called indeed and over there I did a ton of different stuff and from internationalization I was one of the first people to start the internationalization forum for indeed and so they've now expanded to four countries and I think the international traffic revenue is like 30% of their company now,0,0.27356360199342006
3121,They also just got sold for like a billion dollars uh I believe,0,0.4716025486650735
3122,about three weeks ago or something which was really cool,0,0.17963402645220658
3123,But at the same time I don't really want to work there anymore because they have been sold and I don't really know the owner anymore where as I did previously and that was great where I don't know otherwise coming to MITF you know had aphenomenal blast up there,0,0.08679865998235442
3124,I had been studying computer science,0,0.3938730607112474
3125,uhm really enjoyed it and spent a lot of time on a lot of various side projects and just ahnging out with people so like I don't know making really cool robotics stuff,0,0.06788794010145202
3126,uhm like cool educational software,0,0.39245568688584626
3127,uhm some kinnect tax and different things like this,0,0.39245568688584626
3128,Uhm,0,0.2387154408523499
3129,I would I,0,0.4730831849790573
3130,I would go this,0,0.3938730607112474
3131,I I would say there is kind of uhm from two standpoints both from high school and from college in high school I was the captain of our ultimate frisbee team,1,0.5866576737975321
3132,uhm and so I started it in my junior year and just got all my friends because we used to play frisbee all with each other and I said hey why don't we start competing and make this happen liek three times a week or soemthing and so we went ahead and did this and uhm,0,0.4064865837293959
3133,uh started practicing enough and I had to make sure that everything was coordinated and that people actually came to practices I mean you like had to have everyone come and everything otherwise no one is going to wanna play or there is going to be no ability to play basically,0,0.28306467931876694
3134,so uhm we played enough so that we were actually able to get 3rd in uhm well actually 3rd in my senior year 5th my junior year and uh in the state of texas in frisbee which is uh impressive without a coach,0,0.1032468558164049
3135,Uh otherwise I was also the captain of the crosscountry team and uhm uh captain of uhm uh the track team as well so uhm that um roles been more minimal more of an inspirational role like make sure you come to practice sort of thing,1,0.5380555749984539
3136,of stuff and uhm in college here I've been working with a group called saftey fp and uh which promotes student wellness around campus sounds like you've heard of it,1,0.5991253810632329
3137,uhm and yeah so just making sure we have awesome events that happen I just recently read an event called super smash bros turned in which was really great uhm,0,0.16569992293552951
3138,I don't know anything about super smash bros so,0,0.35729155202333646
3139,I had to actually go get the the other people that knew a lot about it and made sure they told all their friends about it and got them to actually figure out the whole thing the whole logistics and that wa sme just getting them excited about it and and convinced them to get a lot of people to come,0,0.31213544981287855
3140,Uhm okay definitely I enjoy teams like no other I'm at MIT specifically I go out of my way to like working in teams and in any different aspect and for the most part I've had really great teams in general but uhm just this semester I'm actually working on a start up with a friend so he's been working on it a while and he's just such an awesome guy that I was just like Oh i want to build stuff for you so I am kind of doing contract work for him we are just hacking together all the time really just like there are no conflicts there frankly but I find but otherwise for my year off for my reasearch that I'm doing here for MIT uhm i had previously uh a research postion at uh my freshman year uhm but I did not really like it that much because I had to do it by myself because it was an android thing I mean I don't know I feel like I can always do stuff by myself it does not have to be in a group but now actually i just tell all my friends if they hear about an opp they should just invite me to do it with you because I would just love to do a year off with someone because like I'd love to have someone that I like to working with and to work on the same product would make everything so much better so like my friend does this cool photography and I just do the tech thing it is fun but in terms of conflicts I've had uhm I feel like conflicts are a general minimal for the uhm the most part that I have found it's most like who is going to do what uhm and in these cases uhm and for the most part and uhm i'm pretty flexible basically that's how I just go around stuff and just try and explain everything very well to everyone just to make sure everyone knows exactly what is going on and just reinterating all this to everyone so that,0,0.1847613923338948
3141,Uhm okay so I would something I woudl change about myself okay so that's interesting uhm oh okay I would almost uhm heh uhm,0,0.3635965128388753
3142,the dumb answer to this would be that I woudl like to be a bit taller i think that would always help,0,0.3937983692193587
3143,Uhm but I think I can also interpret this question on what would I like to work on,1,0.6100299707868481
3144,or what am I working on,0,0.04448763548856515
3145,And like in thsi case i would definitely go for uhm actually my ability to speak ah hah and uhm just in general and uh like I find for now for example like how I kind of seem like I understand what I'm tlaking about for exmample for the most part I,0,0.13113956182223993
3146,Uhm So I know I,0,0.4730831849790573
3147,I would say it just comes down to the passion for the most part I just really enjoy anything that I am working on if I am ever going to pck something to work on i bascially just go at it full force I always tlak to my friends about it it's always on my mind in the shower it's like always in the top of my mind I am working on a problem and I have to get that problem finished and I basically I never really feel like suffer from burn out that may be because I haven't worked on soemthing enough uhm but uhm for the msot part i really enjoy working on stuff and I just it's my passion and my passion is actually just like working when i get tired of working i work on something else it's actually a relaxing state like if I am working here for example I do hard in all my classes I just start programming,0,0.09898247874719385
3148,I feel in a great place I'm either working out or working on soemthing I I I I think your company woudl love to see someone like that,1,0.8088170427287866
3149,I’m doing well,1,0.5724056014340263
3150,I’m a student of computer science at MIT,0,0.3938730607112474
3151,I’m in my Junior year,0,0.4730831849790573
3152,I’ve been studying the whole time,0,0.3938730607112474
3153,I’ve been teaching last summer in the field,0,0.3938730607112474
3154,It was a start up in Venice Beach California and I enjoyed it quite a bit,1,0.5338463461786015
3155,I think that I ca be a leader,1,0.6114423030620092
3156,I am definitely not one that tends to lead,1,0.5724056014340263
3157,I am perfectly happy to play a more supportive role because in my experience especially here there are plenty of people who like to lead and leaders are not needed,1,0.6490718829987913
3158,That said if there’s something that needs to be done and nobody is stepping up to do it that is something that I can and will adapt to,0,0.3022838906250506
3159,I would absolutely consider myself a team player,0,0.4730831849790573
3160,I care more about people than basically anything else,0,0.3938730607112474
3161,Conflict? I’m sorry I am trying to think of a story,1,0.8355582161968379
3162,So to be honest I haven’t experienced major conflicts in general,0,0.08191717026182452
3163,Honestly I think it is best to keep open terms of communication I that makes it so that you can’t have a disaster happen,0,0.22322479893436015
3164,There can be minor disagreements but they never turn into big conflicts,0,0.11521478613197428
3165,I’d be smarter yeah obviously but I think I would like to have a better capability to understand those sides of things,0,0.43832997198318147
3166,Sorry that sounds really weird,0,0.31917787474727255
3167,In general I do but for computer science or science specifically there’s the part that I am really good at which is everything that has to do with languages and puzzle solving that’s great,0,0.23226963873358347
3168,That’s fun,0,0.39245568688584626
3169,I like it a lot,1,0.5724056014340263
3170,But then there is also the side that is a little bit more mathematical and that is something that I struggle with,0,0.04151446662050083
3171,They are definitely different things people are typically good at either one or the other but being good at both is a little less common and that would be really awesome,0,0.21933874093815273
3172,Because I think I would do a great job for you guys,1,0.6712110669180035
3173,I care a lot about my work especially when it affects other people and I really like what this company is doing,0,0.38535842737456816
3174,It is something that I believe in,0,0.3022838906250506
3175,I’m good how are you?,1,0.6359670093958226
3176,Uh so I’m a junior in computer science and math at MIT,0,0.3022838906250506
3177,Uh I’m personally interested in [] systems uh and uh [] tolerance those are slightly more my research interests then my applied interests so when it comes to applied things which you’re probably more interested in um I tend to prefer parallel computing,1,0.5991253810632329
3178,Um I have some experience in that from classes um both including performance engineering and parallel computing as well as from my internship with Amazon where we actually pushed a product that I made,0,0.3235285561025297
3179,You can see it I if you look online uh author rank was my intern product,0,0.21395836163353454
3180,Um… I have some leadership experience but I think that so in my teens for 6172 which is a project based live class … it’s been a lot of work,1,0.6100299707868481
3181,Um I tend to be the person who does some of the organizing of team meetings but mostly within a given meeting I tend to be like for a non-trivial portion of the work,0,0.32230062042973917
3182,The person who is leading the discussions of what’s the next technical step we should do you know should we take approach A or should we take approach A or B based on time work you know man hours we have due dates uh points etcetera,1,0.6309907918770912
3183,Um and so I you know perform leadership skills in a technical capacity more than a managerial one,0,0.3611869277514505
3184,In a sense that I don’t do so much of the organizing of meeting times,0,0.3022838906250506
3185,Um I do think I’m a team player um so can I ask what kind of flavor of conflict you’re looking for? Like a technical disagreement or…,0,0.4588075285625812
3186,Ok um well while I was working at Amazon um we had many times the problem that the business decision would change or um become apparent slowly over time as we continued designing because actually the design process started getting [] over the internship and the product shipped shortly after my internship [],0,0.2030872096727455
3187,So that was kind of crazy um and you may expect with a project like that I ended up not working on the front end because it was way too much work for one intern to do for the summer um but negotiating with the business team and with other technical people about what parts of the product we were going to ship was a challenge,0,0.19106454292257607
3188,As an example Amazon often has uh like you know lots of features like any company like to employ and some of these are like change over time features,1,0.5196231351181234
3189,And as it turns out given the way we were implementing everything change over time features where it looked that longer periods of time would be much more computationally intensive and like also programmer time intensive um both of which weren’t going to work for what we were trying to do for our deadline because we couldn’t order more computational power within the time period and we only had so many man hours,0,0.19732153176187164
3190,And um trying to decide what things would be worked on and what wouldn’t was a conflict of the team um and I did my best um you know I was an intern um but I did my best to like present the technical issues present my understanding of how long things would take um and try to you know encourage people to take the direction they wanted but in the case that a choice was made that wasn’t you know what I wanted uh you know I would go along with it,0,0.10429856273872934
3191,I wasn’t you know going to be petulant or continue trying to you know argue my way and not do their way like if the team decided this was the best thing like I went ahead and did it,1,0.7559305009313493
3192,Uh Smarter,0,0.39245568688584626
3193,Um I’m going to respond to this question by answering what I would change about myself that’s sort of something I could just spend more time on um to change,0,0.3022838906250506
3194,And I can tell you something that I’m currently working on,0,0.11980571834570754
3195,Which is that when I’m stressed and tired I notice that I become snippy is one word for it,0,0.15248303418968046
3196,Uh and while people who have worked with me and you know work on psats until 4 am or you know working on these intense projects you know claim that I tend to be pretty reasonable like it does decrease team unity and happiness,0,0.3829632284737189
3197,When it’s like getting to be 4am and I respond shortly as opposed to you know sounding nice and happy about it,1,0.5380555749984539
3198,Um so something I’m working on is like removing the sounds of frustration from my voice especially in time of frustration because it more important then when everybody’s frustrated and tired to like not escalate situations,0,0.2704138274778955
3199,Um and even if I’m not responding with anger and just responding in like a voice that portrays frustration you can worry that like it’ll make other people more frustrated,0,0.3260083851308101
3200,Um I’m technically competent I think my uh the classes I’ve taken and how well I’ve done in them as well as you know any of the people you contact like Amazon will say positive things about me uh I get along well with people um and so whatever team you put me on will likely enjoy my company,1,0.6712110669180035
3201,Um and I think most importantly computer science is a huge part of my life and what I do and I fully and legitimately enjoy my job especially if you give interesting technical problems Um and I’m sure that’s what your company will do right?,0,0.4588075285625812
3202,So I’m not going to be just like sitting around biding my time waiting for the work day to end and I’m actually going be here on time and I’m going to leave and go home and do other things and like come back and be excited to be coming back to work and continue to work on these problems,0,0.037359185527432524
3203,I'm good how are you?,1,0.6359670093958226
3204,Yeah I paced here hahaha,0,0.3022838906250506
3205,Ok I am a junior at MIT currently uh working on my bachelor's degree in biology and I've been heavily involved in student groups so far and during my time here I've been at uh I'm currently the president of the MIT armenian society the editor in chief of the MIT undergraduate research journal and uh um also executive team of the Biology Students Association uh and I that's why I'm sort of trying to get into healthcare industry and consulting cuz I don't have a lot of experience in the life sciences so far,0,0.3022838906250506
3206,I do think I'm a leader,1,0.6114423030620092
3207,Um I so- always end up taking the lead on uh when there's a big group and someo-someone has to start ha taking the wheel and uh getting people started working,0,0.4716025486650735
3208,Um I've been really involved in the groups that I've -heheh joined since my freshman year and uh so far I've done some pretty crazy things such as organizing a hundred plus networking event for the armenian society where I definitely had to um you know uh work with uh the team and get them motivated enough to help me with this like big task a lot of people-a lot of kids on my team don't really like the whole social um event planning part of things but um I had to kind of engage them and uh that was an interesting thing for me to learn actually how to tap into what makes people take and what gets them motivated so how to give them initiative to do things on their own so,0,0.03797263861152235
3209,Yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
3210,Yeah uh definitely I-I-I would say that I'm a team player and um one thing I can say is that uh last year at the MIT MIT undergraduate research role we uh had to publish an issue uh in the fall where it became late and we had to uh work together as a team to get that done,0,0.3694476305055536
3211,uh one one thing that may I may have done wrong on my part was maybe I-I-I didn't um get my department to uh work hard enough to get the deadline make the deadline so um in the spring semester when we were trying to uh make it make uh make the deadline in the spring semester to publish uh in the first week of the spring semester I had to do the same thing that I did with our (research?) I-or was get everyone to be motivated and have initiative to do things on their own and really like work hard to get t-ah that deadline so yeah,0,0.11279635587987746
3212,mhmm,0,0.2387154408523499
3213,Interesting question,1,0.9036480987850044
3214,Uh I would change my lack of willingness that sometimes to approach new people and you know put myself into new situations that I'm not comfortable with,0,0.3829632284737189
3215,Um I-I definitely have the-the whatever I am comfortable with I feel very confident and I come off as confident at the moment heh but um I sometimes I'm-I-whenever I approach those new situations I'm pretty I'm pretty shy and I-I don't I don't feel comfortable so one thing I would like to change my- about myself is being more adventurous and being more of a risk-taker and I-I feel like I'm too controlled at times but that has gotten me also a-ha very far but it's always good to be a balanced person,0,0.24476056556419554
3216,Hahahaha,0,0.2387154408523499
3217,K So I'm a good leader as I uh said I uh organize a team of around 10 people to organize 100+ networking event people networking event Um I have this ability to understand people where like I which I have to do when I uh have to uh get people to be motivated and like realize what made them take and what made them have initiative on their own so I have a good sense of understanding people um and third I like I said I'm very controlling like y-know not controlling but wrong word controlled haha I-I like to uh really get organized and really um put alot of effort into sort of you know um I guess I guess perfecting every aspect of the-a project that I'm working on whether it be an event a-a-a homework assignment whatever so uh I have that ability as well,0,0.3732504393774121
3218,Yep,0,0.2387154408523499
3219,Good how are you?,1,0.8452898993011722
3220,So my background is primarily in energy work,0,0.1768600974688769
3221,So I'm a chemical engineering student and I'm very interested in not only alternative energy but the optimization of our traditional energy resources,0,0.14153925129016182
3222,Um so that's that's where my uh background in well in gas comes in,0,0.4716025486650735
3223,Um but also some of my research interests are you know kind of scientific ideas,1,0.5380555749984539
3224,Um I definitely think I am,0,0.4316075683376617
3225,Uh partially because even when I'm not the designated leader somehow it turns into me leading the team,0,0.4716025486650735
3226,But I really enjoy that,0,0.06788794010145202
3227,I think that one of the most satisfying feelings is having your team tel you that you're doing a great job or that they think that um that success can be highly attributed to you,1,0.7538129355606162
3228,So I think that in terms of my leadership style I always want to bring out the strengths of the team members,0,0.15455013832531528
3229,So I think that's really how my position as a leader really works,0,0.11320191250810435
3230,I try to figure out what would maximize the potential of this team member or that team member,0,0.3938730607112474
3231,And how can we bring all of those together,0,0.050575491362774505
3232,Um yeah so I definitely consider myself a team player,0,0.3022838906250506
3233,It's tough to be a good leader without being a good team player,0,0.39245568688584626
3234,Ah but one instance where I was both the leader and also a team player um was in the Society of Women Engineers banquet,0,0.3022838906250506
3235,So when we planned it it was,0,0.1066093052570166
3236,I'm the vice president of corporate relations and I have six people who work with me and we planned a banquet for about 200 people both company representatives and students,1,0.5483700112121785
3237,And um and it's a very collaborative effort,0,0.07018898356424853
3238,Like I may be the VP but we're all you know pulling a lot of the weight,1,0.7026102958923996
3239,And so during the actual event we had four company representatives for two different companies show up to the event without RSVP-ing or anything,0,0.1066093052570166
3240,Uh it was the selection for the companies was pretty extensive and the selection for the students was pretty extensive,0,0.39245568688584626
3241,So what we were trying to do was get a good range of industries and then match students with their interests,0,0.09888677476540286
3242,So it's not something where you can be like Oh yeah sit right down but so in terms of being a team player they approached one of the other members of the team,0,0.16870585012516354
3243,She didn't really know what to do um kind of bounced it to a few different people but I knew that that was something that wouldn't look good,0,0.23226963873358347
3244,So I definitely helped her out out of that awkward situation and kind of took the blame on myself essentially because these representatives were pretty angry that Oh you don't have our name tags you don't have our seats? What's going on? And so I you know part of being a team player is knowing when it's best to take the blame on yourself,0,0.09538021435551393
3245,And in the end we found places for them to sit,0,0.1066093052570166
3246,So we had some no-show students you know among like a hundred whatever students you definitely have people that don't show up,0,0.2428917736095061
3247,So they didn't get to sit with like exactly the right students or anything but we found them a place and fed them dinner,0,0.19732153176187164
3248,So that helped,0,0.13457995866975905
3249,I wish I was more patient,1,0.6490718829987913
3250,Um I think I a lot of times and very eager to start a task,1,0.6100299707868481
3251,This especially comes out uh we're in a lab group right now,1,0.5052336361306978
3252,Or I'm in a lab class and I work with a lab group um in that class and we are all we kind of have this trait of um oh as soon as the chemicals are out on the bench oh let's mix this let's do this let's do this,0,0.25353811833686407
3253,But a lot of time we end up finishing a little bit later than other groups because we have to we problem solve,0,0.04721556736134647
3254,We get all the problems first you know other people not having necessarily tried this we find that this doesn't work at all,0,0.3562570264627702
3255,So we face all those hurdles first whereas if we had if we could take a few minutes wait think it out uh maybe let somebody else try something first for a change um I think that would helps us be a little bit more effective,0,0.3731609464718653
3256,And I think in other situations too it's kind of strategic and advantageous to wait but it's sometimes hard for me to see those opportunities,0,0.1352367738043197
3257,So I definitely that's definitely something that I've been working on is you know when when is that also a viable option to just sit back for a few days and just think about it,0,0.14868321799823644
3258,I think that I would bring a great deal of enthusiasm,1,0.7642480901805394
3259,In addition to the skills and background that I have I think that I'm so excited um for the work that your company is doing and to kind of play off the other members of the team as well,1,0.6712110669180035
3260,Um so not just stick to my own project but also be contributing to the other projects that are going on and try to find synergies within our team,0,0.4064865837293959
3261,Doing pretty good,0,0.39245568688584626
3262,So I am a uh mechanical engineer at MIT,0,0.09444753853762607
3263,Umm I am a junior and I'm really interested in product design,0,0.12805425526188313
3264,So I've been taking a lot of classes in design and manufacturing and it's something I've really fallen in love with,0,0.02935760559696661
3265,Like last semester um especially I took this class called,0,0.4716025486650735
3266,[0:25 unclear] Product Design and it's really got me introduced to solid works and using machine tools and it's something that I'd love to do in um for the rest of my life in a professional fashion,0,0.1388294277505842
3267,Uh I would say that I am,0,0.3022838906250506
3268,I do enjoy being in a position where I can really guide a group um towards some forward direction uh,0,0.38535842737456816
3269,So this past year I was philanthropy chair of my sorority and we put on this big event called Cat Walk,0,0.14153925129016182
3270,It's this charity fashion show,0,0.2387154408523499
3271,Um and it's it's so much fun but it took tons of planning and,0,0.13457995866975905
3272,Yeah coordination between like throughout the entire sorority which has one-hundred forty girls in it,0,0.39245568688584626
3273,Um and everyone had to play a role so it's,0,0.2387154408523499
3274,really difficult sometimes 'cause people aren't really sure what's going on and there's a lot of,0,0.05360237764535133
3275,miscommunication and things,0,0.2387154408523499
3276,Umm but I feel like it ran really smoothly um because I had two co-chairs and we all really worked together to keep things very organized um regimented to like keep after people,0,0.4560009826490152
3277,especially in the summer when everyone's all over the country all over the world,0,0.2387154408523499
3278,Right? And you have to just keep emailing them calling them if you can um checking up on them but you know? Finding a balance you have to learn to trust the people that are under you right? Um and just make sure they have a good idea of what's going on and they feel like they're playing an important role because they are,0,0.2623719281198015
3279,Um so that happened actually two weeks ago,0,0.09607975816263775
3280,the event,0,0.2387154408523499
3281,It was so much fun! It was a little bit stressful as we got closer to the event,0,0.2977831921157918
3282,You know things go wrong and things go missing,0,0.0589914937643035
3283,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
3284,but I feel like I was able to stay very calm and just like help people find alternatives if they,0,0.27356360199342006
3285,If I don't know if like a rehearsal time didn't work or a designer wasn't showing up,0,0.4716025486650735
3286,Um it was just best to find a very efficient logical way to proceed,0,0.39245568688584626
3287,Uh I would say that I'm a team player,0,0.3022838906250506
3288,Again like even when in a leadership role you're not just the one person doing the,0,0.45741044182905144
3289,thing,0,0.2387154408523499
3290,Um I would say that being a team player applied to Cat Walk as well but um for a different example perhaps,1,0.5338463461786015
3291,I might return to to product design where we had to work in a smaller team of about uh there were five students and two mentors,1,0.7308450972827195
3292,Um and we all came from different backgrounds and none of us knew each other beforehand,0,0.33141366362000685
3293,We all had very different skill sets and very different personalities,1,0.5052336361306978
3294,Um so in the beginning especially we all had ideas that really clashed and for the class in a way that was good because then we could come up with all these different ideas and it's great,0,0.2571389984462586
3295,But then when it came down to deciding on one or figuring out how you wanted to move forward who would take on which responsibilities it was um quite tense (laughs) for our team I would say,0,0.10286015982892119
3296,Um so as the oldest two on the team myself and one other teammate we,0,0.4064865837293959
3297,I feel like we really stepped it up in terms of being um very methodical and very like,1,0.5569844508131249
3298,Fair I guess? In the way that we tried to distribute things? And when things got too heated um I feel like I especially served as kind of a mediator calming people down and just like having them think about y'know what's practical what are you actually able to get done? Um what do you want to get done? 'Cause you want to make sure that people work on things that they're passionate about um so they can do their best work,0,0.1051927683010028
3299,Um I feel like that's just a role that I play in a lot of team situations? Um helping our team to find a balance so that we can work together most effectively,1,0.7120528119563496
3300,Uh for me I would definitely try to (laughs) raise my own confidence level? Um or my ability to be more assertive,0,0.4716025486650735
3301,I think that when I'm in a team situation where there are very strong personalities I tend to,1,0.7642480901805394
3302,I don't mind sharing my ideas but then as soon as I do if it receives like a lot of criticism or,0,0.43441758665660263
3303,Some sort of um opposition I'll tend to back down um and just kind of let it go and move forward on something else but then sometimes those ideas they turn out to be good ones in the end and it's just like we kind of,0,0.4291592311319982
3304,wasted time,0,0.11521478613197428
3305,Um if only I had more solid arguments to go off of,0,0.4716025486650735
3306,So,0,0.07018898356424853
3307,I try to do a lot more planning on my own time,0,0.4730831849790573
3308,Um so that I do have a solid foundation to go off if I don't get really scared or feel like the ideas I come up with are worthless and I can't defend them,0,0.1388294277505842
3309,I think I should get the job because,1,0.6114423030620092
3310,This position just sounds so ideal for me um it seems like a place like a very collaborative environment? Where I can really call on different uh team members in the office itself um to just help me further my own ideas,0,0.34651595146154224
3311,And I have a lot of room for creative freedom in this product design position,0,0.1768600974688769
3312,Um because from what I've found out through research and talking to uh [5:41 unclear] or company members um,0,0.18755857915192653
3313,is just that we're often given a challenge that's very dynamic and there's always problems to be solved and um things to innovate on,0,0.3523851046866215
3314,And,0,0.07018898356424853
3315,they basically just say Go do it,0,0.2387154408523499
3316,Um and I think that's really exciting to me because I don't,0,0.34651595146154224
3317,I'm not a big fan of of just doing things very rotely like Here's how I want you to do it,1,0.7070690685863894
3318,Um just like build exactly what these directions tell you to do,0,0.45741044182905144
3319,Um not quite what I'm looking for and so I think this company um this position just really really excites me,0,0.34651595146154224
3320,Fine thanks how are you?,1,0.9723827022850665
3321,Well I'm a junior at MIT and currently I'm majoring in Computer Science and molecular biology with a minor in Management,0,0.4716025486650735
3322,Um my work background I've done a year op at uh in Boyden's Lab uh which is in neurobiology lab and I really like that but I'm interested in maybe pursuing Finance as a career,0,0.08546649212793798
3323,So the past two summers um I've worked in financial services,0,0.1768600974688769
3324,Um my freshman summer I worked at Standard & Poor's and last summer I worked at Wells Fargo,0,0.2704138274778955
3325,Uh I definitely think I'm a leader because uh currently I'm on a lot of planning boards for different things uh I'm actually on the Executive Board on Smart Women's Securities which is a finance club and I've really helped it grow from a very small group of about ten members to now we have like 30 or 40 students attending each of our seminar series so its been great being in a marketing role for that club uh because I've been able to pub on campus and get people to come out to our events,0,0.4560009826490152
3326,Uh yes I think I'm a team player um one time this was for one of my classes we had a project uh it was in a class called software programming in Java,1,0.5455338645201713
3327,So the project was actually centered after Spring Break,0,0.010514505885992124
3328,and it was due on that Wednesday,0,0.07018898356424853
3329,However one of my friends who was supposed to be in charge of another part of the project was gone the entire Spring Break on a bike trip and didn't bring his computer,0,0.18755857915192653
3330,So he came back to school and said guys sorry I haven't done anything and well that was a very bad conflict for our team so I kind of took charge and said Look okay I'll finish the parser and you write just test cases for the entire program instead since obviously you haven't even started looking at it,1,0.8020383731180267
3331,So yeah we ended up getting an A on that project thankfully but it was a marathon sprint to the finish,0,0.1066093052570166
3332,This is a very loaded question,0,0.2387154408523499
3333,Um I think one thing I might change about myself is being a little bit more proactive in everything I do sometimes I'm a little too passive but yeah I think that's the main thing I would change about myself,0,0.24476056556419554
3334,I would try to make myself take more initiatives,0,0.4730831849790573
3335,I think I should get the job because I'm a very strong candidate in this industry and I have a lot of prior experience in Finance so,1,0.7642480901805394
3336,Also I'm very motivated and I'll get work done,0,0.4716025486650735
3337,Little cold,0,0.11521478613197428
3338,Pretty well,0,0.39245568688584626
3339,How are you?,0,0.15445987288440202
3340,I have some quantity and analytical experience from Qua work on financial team last summer in terms’ of working experience a in terms of academic experience I have a apply a math major probably double major with course fifteen which is management so I taken a lot of probability statistics classes,1,0.7035513784479208
3341,Ah I think I am a leader mainly because I take a leadership positions I can be very effective in guiding the group whatever it is toward our goal,1,0.7120528119563496
3342,If it is team in the class on the research project even if there is a like assign leadership role I usually end up organizing things between people stuff like that,1,0.5338463461786015
3343,So I do feel like I am a little bet a natural leader,0,0.27356360199342006
3344,A when I was in competitive swimming summer for fifteen years pretty much my whole life and so I had lots of different experiences being on the swim team specially on (??) I did for two years specialty on m rely team there is only four slots on the rely and we are usually very competitive on the national level so last year we had lots of conflict a because one of my best fiends really wonted to be on the rely but then you know she is getting bit up by a teammates and there is all that drama over that and it put me in a tough position because was my best friend but then was also you know you wont to put together the fastest rely to be competitive so really all of was wont to stay out of it and let the coaches deal with that but I did learn a lot about how to interact with people on all sides of the situation because I steel had to get along with all my teammates and support my best friend and try to help her,0,0.142306811873475
3345,I think I would like to be better in asking for help not that I necessarily needed a lot but I think it would be useful for me and like branch out and learn from different people so I am really interested in math and management so I get really into those types of classes I guess I wish I would branch out little bet more in to different areas because I can learn from people there,0,0.20919740887807237
3346,Si I am trying to take some different classes now that I ma done with all of my math and stuff like that,0,0.4716025486650735
3347,That’s probably what I should change,0,0.3572911640991484
3348,I think I should get the job because I am really qualified,1,0.5235537960611565
3349,I have the qua experience as well some of the financial background,1,0.5724056014340263
3350,I am also just a hard worker really excited to learn more in the job and since this is a such learning internship I think I could really thrive in that environment,0,0.3133450648821134
3351,Sure uh my names Isaiah I'm an MIT student I am currently a junior in the department of aeronautics and astronautics,0,0.3022838906250506
3352,um and so I I'm mainly focusing on the information systems behind uhh aeronautics and uhh aeronautical and astronautical flight systems,0,0.118032441819917
3353,umm my course work basically has included a fair amount of the basics of aeronautics and astronautics that's covered at MIT,0,0.4716025486650735
3354,Uhh in addition to that I've covered a lot of programming and programming work,0,0.4716025486650735
3355,umm both in and out of school umm so that has included uhh basically building a UAV from scratch as well as umm working on UAV programming for the department of defense umm which has uhh been done for collision avoidance for a lot of the UAV's now flying in the air,0,0.2115156921086478
3356,So yeah I do think I'm a leader umm so for example uhh right now I'm actually holding several different leadership positions,0,0.20919740887807237
3357,uhh first of all I am the residential director for a group called [medlinks?] in my dorm uhh what we do is we provide students uhh health care support basically,1,0.5852163666581659
3358,uhh we are authorized to give out over the counter medicines to other students uhh in our dorm and as well as well as elsewhere,1,0.5052336361306978
3359,uhh we're certified first aid and some basic emergency care and we're also there for uhh basically student health counseling um so in my position as residential director umm I basically talk to the dorm executive board as well as the medlinks executive board and uhh we basically work together I work as the Liason between the groups um and I basically help plan events um I work with them to resolve whatever issues are coming up I [xx] meetings for them umm basically to help support basically the people who support our dorm,1,0.5483700112121785
3360,umm in addition to that I kind of have like a quirky side leadership position which is umm as president of the MIT tapioca club umm we make and distribute large quantities of tapioca so every once in a while umm we will I will be organizing a whole bunch of students getting together maybe like a night or two of crazy cooking umm you know ha ha,0,0.19106454292257607
3361,Umm sure so uhh yes I do consider myself a team player I've had to work in a whole bunch of different teams for example one time there was a bit of a conflict umm well it was basically when last year I was working on a uhh one of my assignments for an engineering class uh we had a problem in which basically one of the students wouldn't show up one of the other students [xx] let me get this straight one of the students had trouble showing up for basically the team meetings and another one of them kind of basically got [xx] at that,0,0.3694476305055536
3362,So the way I helped umm sort of resolve this conflict and basically bring everybody together to try to work out the project was I basically took it upon myself to help the person to figure out why the person who wasn't showing up wasn't showing up umm and I basically helped him work through some of the stuff that he had issues with mainly he wasn't showing up mainly because he felt he didn't like wasn't able to contribute enough didn't know enough about the programs we were working with so I basically sat there and talked him through it helped him basically develop some of the skills necessary to work with it so in that way he basically showed up a lot more he was much more productive and useful to the team and that also um basically helped resolve the conflict we had in which we had you know we avoided losing a team member basically and we avoided another problem of umm basically an annoyed team member having to deal with a person who he felt wasn't doing his job,0,0.2439282069851289
3363,Um so this is actually something that I am actively working on I feel that I should be more compassionate um this is actually something that um so during my medlinks training something that actually appeared um basically what we were doing we were doing a bit of an exercise um in which we were presented with a couple of different cases to basically umm illustrate how it might be for a person to go through some very very difficult uh I guess difficult times or difficult trials um and so we were basic we were given scenarios to imagine sort of like umm maybe the loss of a loved one or the loss of a secure place to be uh loss of some sort of you know a whole bunch of different losing things and um I guess I wasn't I wasn't as moved as other students were primarily because I've been through all of the examples that they gave so I don't know I guess on one hand that's a good thing on the other hand that's a bad thing but umm what that pointed out to me was that like I wasn't perhaps able to empathize as well as the others were um despite I don't know either despite or specifically because I had been through that and um part of the reason that I joined medlinks and am now currently actually trying to join the [MITEMS?] umm not because I want to pursue medicine as a career but one because I want to develop those skills and two because I want to sort of develop and exercise more compassion,0,0.0985811586277544
3364,Um so I think I should get the job basically because of one my past experiences which have prepared me fairly well for the kind of employee that your looking for a person with good strong aerospace and science background as well as strong coding skills that are necessary for the umm basically kind of projects that I know you are working on,1,0.6712110669180035
3365,additionally I feel that I am a very reliable person um I have demonstrated that through my leadership positions through the things that I have initia- um sort of taken the initiative to engage in such as the various programs I mentioned and you know the things I am trying to do right now because of that I feel that I would be a valuable asset to your team,1,0.6712110669180035
3366,It's what it sounds like,0,0.39245568688584626
3367,We try to make it more than boba tea umm currently we have primarily made boba tea so its like I think we've done like two or three events and basically every time its like ok I'm gonna go to china town get like twenty to thirty pounds of tapioca bring it back and then like well spend like basically a night or two cooking making large quantities of tea,1,0.7120528119563496
3368,I think what we're trying to do right now is kind of actually get enough funds to get a cup sealing machine that way the club will be self sustainable 'cause like right now its MIT funded but its so new that they won't give it consistent funding we have to apply for new grants,1,0.5569844508131249
3369,so we're like oh you know we're paying MIT all this money to be here why not make them give us money for food?,0,0.2428917736095061
3370,My background is I grew up in Japan and wanted to go to M,0,0.4730831849790573
3371,to study aerospace engineering wanted to fly for a very long time now,0,0.2387154408523499
3372,I am in Sigma Alpha Epsilon a fraternity on campus,0,0.3938730607112474
3373,And I am also a member of Air Force ROTC,0,0.09444753853762607
3374,I do think I'm a leader,1,0.6114423030620092
3375,I have had many opportunities to lead,1,0.5724056014340263
3376,Um both in a in a range of environments where it's it's pure leadership and also areas it's very clear that I'm the one in charge and that people should be listening to me,1,0.5338463461786015
3377,And I've also had a good amount of theoretical education on this and most of those opportunities and the education's been through ROTC,0,0.1768600974688769
3378,But I have also had a decent amount of chances to lead through things like student government in high school and through my fraternity in college,0,0.1768600974688769
3379,I do think I'm a team player,1,0.6114423030620092
3380,I like to be on part of a team where the mission is something I agree with and if I am then I'll work my absolute hardest and try to make sacrifices for the team,1,0.6490718829987913
3381,In terms of a team that had conflict that I was um I was apart of uh hmm let me think of examples I didn't use the first time,0,0.39521743774958146
3382,[pause] I have to go back to high school,0,0.3022838906250506
3383,Um so student government was a really big thing for me in high school,0,0.09607975816263775
3384,It was probably my favorite activity my favorite non-athletic activity that I did and it was a little bit difficult to get participation especially during busier times for school because people would have so many other commitments to go to,0,0.32230062042973917
3385,So in some of the committees we had inside student government Junior Senior year there would just be not enough people for not even a quorum to be reached,0,0.19732153176187164
3386,So-,0,0.2387154408523499
3387,The way I tried to change that was just making the events we do more fun and having people specifically agree on those things that were on the committee beforehand,1,0.5852163666581659
3388,So then they- we knew that everybody had kind of an investment in it,0,0.1066093052570166
3389,One thing about myself hmm,0,0.3022838906250506
3390,[laughs] Well kind of as a joke right now one thing definitely have a leg that's healed,0,0.2115156921086478
3391,Um but-,0,0.2387154408523499
3392,I guess-,0,0.3938730607112474
3393,[laughs] Personality traits are something of that nature,0,0.2387154408523499
3394,[pause] Um I think i can be a little bit more agr- or not a little bit a decently am- a decent more- a decent amount more agreeable,1,0.6100299707868481
3395,Sometimes I certainly can have an opinion on a stance and once it's developed it's quite hard to change,0,0.18755857915192653
3396,I can dig my heels in when someone's kind of trying to argue the Congress,1,0.5353244206591785
3397,So if I could be just a little more open minded and certainly more agreeable I think that would help me out in the long run,0,0.27356360199342006
3398,I think that I should be able to get this job because I have a lot to contribute to the company,1,0.6114423030620092
3399,I learn so much in my undergrad and I've been wanting to apply that to a real- to a tough problem that has real uh repercussions to the general public,0,0.43441758665660263
3400,And I've learned a lot of uh theoretical knowledge on on how to solve these problems,0,0.04151446662050083
3401,I've also learned a lot of practical things by being in projects and working in groups and and learning how to handle a range- or a multitude of different dynamics,0,0.3938730607112474
3402,Um I- if- if the team is working towards a goal which I agree on and this company certainly is-,0,0.3022838906250506
3403,I- I'll put absolutely a hundred percent of effort into it and work late and- and really try to get that goal um or really try to work towards that goal,0,0.31213544981287855
3404,Sure,0,0.2387154408523499
3405,So I am match-making computer science double major at MIT,0,0.09444753853762607
3406,I worked in the product-tech and business space before umm doing both uh front end web development for example at Next Job and product management for example at Douche Ban the German railway and Disney Parks and Resorts online,1,0.5724056014340263
3407,Sure,0,0.2387154408523499
3408,I think I,1,0.532476616497347
3409,I am,0,0.3938730607112474
3410,Umm one example of that is I'm the president of Baker House-it's a dorm at MIT,0,0.3022838906250506
3411,Umm and as part of that I--there's about twenty members of the executive committee um and we run um events during the year- about a fifty thousand dollar budget,0,0.4064865837293959
3412,Um so making sure all of those run run smoothly um that there aren't conflicts between members of the team that the umm other business of Baker House gets done and gets done in an efficient way and a way that's good for the residents that are there,0,0.2115156921086478
3413,Sure so this sem-or this past summer at Disney uh we had a challenge once with the time zones um and how they would be uh and how the app would be able to use time zones,0,0.33141366362000685
3414,So we uh spent some time to got everyone on the phone together on a conference call and talked about umm what the app would have to do in order to support time zones,0,0.19732153176187164
3415,Sure,0,0.2387154408523499
3416,I think the,1,0.532476616497347
3417,the one thing that I um you know maybe I,0,0.4204536666629771
3418,maybe it's,0,0.2869118389241647
3419,it's a false sort of sense of of what umm of something but at MIT it always seems like some people get the answers to some questions faster than I do and umm you know it's it's probably just you know their particular field that they are good in but you know some magical way of of you know being able to do that would be good,0,0.16949659631330274
3420,Uhh huh,0,0.2387154408523499
3421,Yep,0,0.2387154408523499
3422,Mmm-hmm,0,0.2387154408523499
3423,Absolutely,0,0.2387154408523499
3424,Umm you know I think it's something that I've,0,0.497733547164182
3425,I've certainly done before something that I'm able to pick up quickly and uh really customize it you know to this particular company umm and I think that's you know there's there's few other candidates that have had this sort of graph of experience that I've had,0,0.14353013803011744
3426,Yep,0,0.2387154408523499
3427,No problem,0,0.11521478613197428
3428,Sure um [clears throat] sorry,1,0.7402000269383907
3429,Uh I am a junior in Computer Science here at MIT,0,0.3022838906250506
3430,I’m from [??] Kentucky,0,0.3938730607112474
3431,Uh particularly interesting in uh consumer [??] products um front end development,0,0.39245568688584626
3432,Um I’ve had some experience doing both web development and some uh internal metrics testing and QA type of jobs,0,0.3022838906250506
3433,So that’s a little bit about my technical background,0,0.09444753853762607
3434,I do think I’m a leader,1,0.6114423030620092
3435,I think one of the biggest qualities a leader needs to have is dealing with people,1,0.532476616497347
3436,Uh people skills are very important,0,0.39245568688584626
3437,I’ve been involved in many situations that uh involve both conflict resolution with people involve organizing people towards a certain a certain purpose or goal which I think is uh very important uh quality of being a leader,1,0.5737824960575687
3438,For example um previous uh work uh I’ve done with one of [??] organizations on campus called Camp [??] of MIT uh we had a committee that my myself and my co-coordinator had a committee which we we used to organize the unions for campers and um newsletters for uh families,1,0.5852163666581659
3439,Uh to give you more context with that uh my job in that organization was to be a liaison between organization which was a student camp a student run camp for kids whose parents have or had had cancer –,0,0.19015119047044987
3440,- and being a liaison for the organization in the families who go to that camp,0,0.2387154408523499
3441,So that was my whole last year and I believe I was able to organize uh I believe pretty effectively,0,0.1768600974688769
3442,Right now I’m uh also a member of the MIT dance troupe which uh is a dance group on campus,0,0.4716025486650735
3443,And I’ve uh I’m choreog - I’m a choreographer,0,0.09444753853762607
3444,So I’m organizing people there and definitely making sure we meet our deadlines on time for the big show that we hold every semester,0,0.14153925129016182
3445,So I think I can uh organize people pretty effectively and uh have a really good [??],0,0.11320191250810435
3446,Sure okay,0,0.2387154408523499
3447,Um I think dealing with doing these… Let’s go with so uh the same organization Camp [??] organization last year as the coordinator for the uh families,0,0.15455013832531528
3448,A big challenge for us was uh organizing our data,0,0.33141366362000685
3449,Um so how that so essentially what I mean by that is each uh family had to apply uh with their camper’s applications but the applications itself are pretty pretty heavy and require a lot of information doctor’s records medical records and so people would send in their applications at different parts –,1,0.5338463461786015
3450,- uh during the year,0,0.2387154408523499
3451,Um so they would never usually send in a full application,0,0.2869118389241647
3452,So keeping track of that um proved to be pretty pretty challenging in itself,0,0.060661407047331486
3453,Um there were about three of us that they would send different parts to uh and there were about ninety campers or about a hundred campers who ended up sending in documents,0,0.33141366362000685
3454,So uh making sure that uh my team was communicating was important very very important,0,0.1768600974688769
3455,In order to get through that –,0,0.2387154408523499
3456,- um we decided to develop a uh sort of tool for uh organizing,0,0.33141366362000685
3457,In the sense that –,0,0.2387154408523499
3458,- uh whoever received that piece of the application would enter it in to this sort of database we decided to construct,0,0.33141366362000685
3459,Uh fill in the application and contact the family saying what they were missing and what they have turned in,0,0.2387154408523499
3460,‘Cause sometimes there was a little bit of a lasp [sic] in communication about who was to tell the parents about what they were missing and things of that nature,0,0.2869118389241647
3461,Uh I think it worked pretty well,1,0.6100299707868481
3462,Uh it was definitely a system which could be used in future years,0,0.2387154408523499
3463,Um –,0,0.2387154408523499
3464,- unfortunately they switch to a different system an online system this year so we don’t implement anymore,0,0.17070910373751436
3465,That was a pretty solid system,0,0.39245568688584626
3466,Yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
3467,‘K,0,0.2387154408523499
3468,I think for me –,1,0.532476616497347
3469,- um wrist-taking,0,0.2387154408523499
3470,Risk-taking is probably something I could uh work on,0,0.32230062042973917
3471,Now I don’t mean by risk-taking taking risks just for the sake of risks but being more open to uh trying something I’m not uh particularly uh familiar with or uh don’t know exactly what the outcome is going to be,0,0.15248303418968046
3472,Uh it’s definitely something I could uh give more thought towards,0,0.3572911640991484
3473,I’m generally a conservative person when making decisions and trying to go with um solutions that I can definitely plan out and foresee but I understand that especially in the real world there are times when uh you just don’t know what’s going to happen with uh later down the line and decisions have to be made,0,0.3843680089104777
3474,So keeping that in mind um knowing when to take risk and definitely being more open to alternative ways of uh going down a certain path to a solution is something I could uh I’d uh I’d like to change about myself,0,0.08191717026182452
3475,Mm,0,0.2387154408523499
3476,So uh I think that the biggest one of the biggest qualities in me for me is uh being able to uh being eager and able to learn very quickly,0,0.27356360199342006
3477,I’m a very eager um to learn individual,1,0.5724056014340263
3478,I’ve uh come into internships before not knowing much about the sort of technology and frameworks they use,0,0.3938730607112474
3479,For example this past summer at my internship at this small company uh I had never used Ruby or many of the JavaScript frameworks they had used before uh and many of the testing frameworks,0,0.3022838906250506
3480,And I just have to hit the ground running but I think I have a very uh big enthusiasm for learning new things and it’s one of uh the greatest joys in the world to me is to like go in and just learn uh a new technology and put it into practice,0,0.27356360199342006
3481,So I think that uh what I may lack for in experience I more than make up for in uh very eager um to learn uh attitude and ability to pick up things pretty quickly in practice,0,0.1352367738043197
3482,No problem,0,0.11521478613197428
3483,Thanks for having me,1,0.929060350894491
3484,OK so I'm a student here at MIT and I love to study electrical engineering and computer science,0,0.1768600974688769
3485,Umm you know very quantitatively minded,0,0.2903869332990904
3486,I'm also minoring in mathematics and economics and I'm interested in a variety of applications of math and computer science to you know any sort of field that has interesting problems that can bring together a practical application and a use of my technical skill set,1,0.5005949175226722
3487,Yeah I think so I think I think I have umm I have a talent for being able to identify what motivates people and in organizations it's very easy to you know get caught up in what's perceived to be you know? Everyone's common motive that the companies supposed to be about,1,0.5045715944777942
3488,And although the ideal framework would be nice if everyone was working indeed towards the same goal in reality sometimes you know different agents different people in the company different people in the group have different you know slightly different goals for they're in the game in the first place,0,0.2066034157898696
3489,And I think by being able to recognize these individual motives and being able to marshal them instead of being a destructive force towards the company being able to marshal everyone's individual talents or desires umm as a force that can be used to benefit the company I think this sort of you know deeper deeper attention to what people want is what we- wha- wha- what basically makes me be able to be a you know a good leader by being able to take all the resources that are provided by the team and use the parts to make a good whole sum,0,0.08349850969658229
3490,I think yeah I uhh yeah I am a team player umm within reason of course,1,0.6114423030620092
3491,As long as I don't think some ridiculous demand is being made of me,0,0.2397396965153384
3492,Which is demeaning or it's just not useful in terms of it if there's a demand being made of me that's not fulfilled by me and my skill set then I will you know defer to someone else on the team,1,0.558341487911681
3493,But given that it is a demand or a request that's made that will tailor itself to my skill set I I think that I'm a team player,0,0.43832997198318147
3494,Umm you know for example I'm more skilled at quantitative analysis than people from maybe other backgrounds and there have been many times you know working on group projects and interdisciplinary crafts where I would be asked to take on some extra role for data analysis just simply because I have more experience in the field,1,0.5991253810632329
3495,And it would be just more beneficial to the entire to team to have someone who already has more experience,0,0.13457995866975905
3496,To not have to enter the learning curve at the steepest point umm but instead to be able to produce you know good work pretty quickly,0,0.45741044182905144
3497,If I were to change one- one thing about myself it would umm it would probably have to be,0,0.3572911640991484
3498,I guess being umm being more mindful of my time and being a little more meticulous to make sure that all those you know unaccounted for minutes that past by over the course of the day uhh don't add up you know? Into large chunks of time that are being unused,1,0.8088170427287866
3499,I wish I had a better sense of realizing quickly when my time is not being used optimally and freedom to actually correct that,0,0.38535842737456816
3500,So I I think that for most jobs and this one as well in a very quantitative field which does also involve you know leading a team of different people from various backgrounds I think that I would be you know uniquely skilled for this job because I do have a strong technical background while I can also take different parts of a team and bring together people with you know they have different motives initially into a coherent unit to get a job done,0,0.32951325534129816
3501,Thank you very much,1,0.9723827022850665
3502,So I'm a math major at MIT,0,0.09444753853762607
3503,I'm a junior,0,0.3938730607112474
3504,Um specifically study uh Applied Mathematics and Computer Science,0,0.2387154408523499
3505,Uh I have a focus on statistics and algorithms,0,0.3022838906250506
3506,Um I think of myself sometimes as a leader,0,0.4316075683376617
3507,Um definitely able to organize things and get things done when they need to be done,0,0.2387154408523499
3508,Um ahem I'm not the most organized person,0,0.3022838906250506
3509,Uh so in some regard I have doubt,0,0.32230062042973917
3510,But uh I think I've been pretty successful in getting groups to acheive goals and that kind of thing,0,0.27356360199342006
3511,Um so I I think I am a team player,0,0.4316075683376617
3512,Um I have a pretty diverse background as far as um CS and math-related kinda things go and so um I'm pretty good at working with different uh people from different backgrounds,0,0.4716025486650735
3513,Specifically in those fields uh also in other fields,0,0.2387154408523499
3514,Um I think the particular challenge with that is being able to communicate to uh team members your your ideas if uh they're not exactly familiar with them,0,0.497733547164182
3515,Sure,0,0.2387154408523499
3516,So I think one thing that I certainly don't like is that I tend to be very nervous,0,0.1352367738043197
3517,Um especially when speaking in front of uh large groups of people,0,0.2387154408523499
3518,And I think definitely if I could avoid that problem it's certainly be good,0,0.1352367738043197
3519,Um one of the things because you're always given the opportunity to talk in front of people and it's uh whether you're presenting work or you're socializing or something meeting new people,0,0.45741044182905144
3520,It's always something that you have to deal with and you know being being very sociable or being around a lot of people is certainly very helpful,1,0.5196231351181234
3521,Um so I think one of the reasons is that I enjoy a good challenge,1,0.6100299707868481
3522,Um and I enjoy very challenging problems which I know that your company certainly offers,0,0.3260083851308101
3523,Um another reason is the my my interests are very aligned with the company's interests and I think that um both could benefit from learning uh especially myself from your company and the people I work with,1,0.6712110669180035
3524,Uh well I go to MIT,0,0.4716025486650735
3525,I'm a senior right now,1,0.5724056014340263
3526,And I'll be graduating [??],0,0.09444753853762607
3527,Yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
3528,Uh to me a leader is somebody who takes initiative and like creates a vision when they're given a blank slate,0,0.39245568688584626
3529,Uh when when I think somebody is a leader they they don't have to be told what's done or what needs to get done,0,0.4316075683376617
3530,And they form the infinite choices and possibilities can quickly pick up two or three and make a decision,0,0.07018898356424853
3531,And also like get other people excited about it and organized,0,0.13457995866975905
3532,Hum Oh yeah,0,0.11521478613197428
3533,Obviously I do think I'm a team player,0,0.4316075683376617
3534,I'm trying to think of an example,0,0.45468571979582034
3535,One specific challenge,0,0.2387154408523499
3536,The uh for the [??] project you do as a senior,0,0.2903869332990904
3537,We had to ah my group was in charge of analysing the materials and we of the section that I got asigned was was ah within our team we did like a self ah splitting it up,0,0.3694476305055536
3538,And I got like a way way heavy load and somebodies got to really like move,0,0.06788794010145202
3539,So it was like pretty I didn't know if I should talk to somebody else about it or something like that,0,0.3635965128388753
3540,And I decided like if we were going to do it as a team,0,0.25353811833686407
3541,Then we're going to have to be on the same page,0,0.1066093052570166
3542,So at some of my meeting we made sure to split it up a little more evenly,0,0.12361406746916685
3543,To never have to sleep,0,0.2387154408523499
3544,Like realistically? Is this like ah,0,0.39245568688584626
3545,Not going to answer things like that,0,0.39245568688584626
3546,Uh definitely to be more organized,0,0.2387154408523499
3547,So a lot of time I'll get like my notes will get messy and stuff like that,0,0.08191717026182452
3548,Organization,0,0.2387154408523499
3549,I've been working on it but it's not where it needs to be,0,0.13527336758414843
3550,Yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
3551,I do,0,0.3938730607112474
3552,Uh cause I work well with other groups and this job requires like small groups to work together to accomplish things,0,0.4716025486650735
3553,And a small group is like the perfect environment for me to do work that is collaborative but it's not like bureaucratic,0,0.13457995866975905
3554,So so this is like the perfect environment and uh and I have like some experience in the area,0,0.1768600974688769
3555,But more importantly like I I figure things out and get them done,0,0.1768600974688769
3556,Like as they need to be so people don't have to tell me what to do or watch over me and stuff like that,0,0.39245568688584626
3557,Like it's if I want something to be accomplished like we'll work with a team to get it done,1,0.5852163666581659
3558,Without like somebody telling you or watching you whatever,0,0.45741044182905144
3559,Yup,0,0.2387154408523499
3560,Good,1,0.9036480987850044
3561,It's been a tough week,0,0.39245568688584626
3562,Uhm my name is <inaudible> I am Junior in course 20,0,0.15248303418968046
3563,Which is Biological Engineering,0,0.2387154408523499
3564,I come from Puerto Rico,0,0.3938730607112474
3565,And,0,0.07018898356424853
3566,I've been learning a bit more this past year about what I actually want to do in life,0,0.23333067621579343
3567,Right now my main goals are set more towards the medicine side of Bioengineering,0,0.4716025486650735
3568,So medical devices biomaterials tissue engineering drug delivery it's what it's what interests me right now,0,0.13457995866975905
3569,Uh,0,0.2387154408523499
3570,it's not set right now that's why I am also tending to go to different research opportunities and different uh,0,0.4716025486650735
3571,pharmaceutical internships and we'll see what happens from there on,0,0.33141366362000685
3572,And I'll be able to focus on one actual path per say,0,0.09444753853762607
3573,So,0,0.07018898356424853
3574,I think I am leader because I like planning things,1,0.7642480901805394
3575,I like to gather all the information I have all the resources I have and all the uh,1,0.6490718829987913
3576,basically either group uh,0,0.2387154408523499
3577,all the group <inaudible> or each contribution from each person gather them all up and come up with an efficient plan to tackle said problem or homework or project or presentation,0,0.2115156921086478
3578,Whichever may be the case,0,0.2869118389241647
3579,I tend to make people give more than,0,0.3938730607112474
3580,I make them give more than 100% of what the they they the bar that they set themselves at,0,0.3938730607112474
3581,So I feel if I feel that somebody has potential I can notice it and at the same time work with a person to basically exploit that potential to a new maximum,0,0.1352367738043197
3582,At the same way I feel that I am very open to constructive criticism if somebody feels that I am not doing a great job I am very happy just to sit with them and learn from that experience because it's gonna make me more efficient in the future,0,0.3937983692193587
3583,So I feel that just having a set plan from the start to tackle problems and at the same way editing it and adapting it to every new situation or the feelings of the people you are basically uh overseeing then that's uh a very good approach to everything that we do,0,0.2439282069851289
3584,So uh teams have been uh very large aspect of my life,0,0.09444753853762607
3585,Ever since High School I've been a part of the Soccer team,0,0.3022838906250506
3586,I continue to do that now,0,0.3938730607112474
3587,I've been part of the debate team and Honor Society which had it's own team for competitions,1,0.5724056014340263
3588,But I feel that the biggest challenge right now has been when I am with a team of people that are seniors to me,0,0.27356360199342006
3589,So they they are better prepared much better informed and have an arsenal of skills that I have yet to acquire because I just don't have the same level of experience that they have,0,0.1768600974688769
3590,So if I am Sophomore and I've been grouped with Seniors and Juniors of my subject of Engineering class the difference is very noticeable,0,0.09444753853762607
3591,The difference of level and performance is very noticeable,0,0.2387154408523499
3592,And I try to basically give what I can but I also want to excel at what I can actually move forward to,0,0.06788794010145202
3593,So if I feel that I can actually contribute much more than what they're expecting of me because if I don't have that level of experience what I want to do is get to that level,0,0.058349808998298384
3594,So I gotta work harder push through and get to this level that's basically at the same level as the rest of the group,0,0.1768600974688769
3595,So I'll try to work with people and I'll try to find someone who mentor me through that process,0,0.1768600974688769
3596,And step by step because the biggest challenge for me is being alone and tackling it straight I'll use the other group members I'll readily approach them and ask for help because that's what the group is for,0,0.3080838209192851
3597,The team succeeds together all the way,0,0.39245568688584626
3598,So,0,0.07018898356424853
3599,that's I go,0,0.3022838906250506
3600,I would say doubting,0,0.3938730607112474
3601,Doubting myself doubting the things I do doubting the decisions I make,0,0.3022838906250506
3602,I would like to have absolutely no regrets or if I have them learn something from them,0,0.43441758665660263
3603,I am sometimes am fairly a safe player so I calculate the risks before I see the return,0,0.1917622658599578
3604,So I'm not a great fan of plunging in into something that I don't know that's high risk high return,0,0.08191717026182452
3605,I like to play it safe and have a thing to fall back on,0,0.35729155202333646
3606,The same way it works for problems it works for personal life it works for basically everything that's surrounds me,0,0.2115156921086478
3607,I feel that it's been changing with every new experience I've been passing through,1,0.6114423030620092
3608,Leaving home college outside of Puerto Rico but I still feel that I'll rarely benefit of just letting go and taking more of a risk than I normally do,0,0.3937983692193587
3609,The first one that pops right into mind is,0,0.39245568688584626
3610,Bioengineering,0,0.2387154408523499
3611,So I've always been naturally curious about things,0,0.09444753853762607
3612,I've always had a drive behind everything I do so I got into Bioengineering right after I saw that I had this opportunity coming to MIT and coming from a family that has been effected by a lot of cancer I found that doing this I could actually benefit my family benefit other people's families that have been effected by it,0,0.20657798909957484
3613,I've been going through some really tough times with grandmothers and other family members that have survived and succumbed to it,0,0.31213544981287855
3614,And from there my motivation has been always to push forward no matter what the challenge,0,0.09444753853762607
3615,So when I step into a lab I see what I have in front of me the ultimate goal might be the farthest goal in my life I may never reach it but rest assured that I will do my best to contribute to its forward movement,0,0.21611320583280333
3616,I will always try and leave it at a better place than it was before and if I am not the one to reach it another person will but I will be sure that I actually contributed to it,0,0.38535842737456816
3617,Alright so my background I'm a junior at MIT studying computer science and umm I've also done research in the computer science field,0,0.4730831849790573
3618,Umm I interned er I researched with a group at MIT and what we did was we made an interactive game to uh to teach,0,0.4064865837293959
3619,And I've also had some experience uh internship at uh at Google,0,0.09444753853762607
3620,I think I'm a leader,1,0.6114423030620092
3621,I do believe I have leadership uh qualities and that and I can support this because I've been in leadership positions in organizations here on campus,0,0.3080838209192851
3622,And when I have had the responsibilities I've carried them out uh very well and I've been able to overcome challenges such as umm one of the groups I'm uh on the executive board of expedited access to standard education,0,0.1768600974688769
3623,Umm one of the our tasks this semester was to come up with an idea for a presentation and to carry it out at a control show from another group,0,0.33141366362000685
3624,And I took complete ownership of that and it came out pretty well and we were able to raise more money than we have in the past,0,0.25353811833686407
3625,Oh well I definitely would consider myself a team player and an example would be from uh my participation in my team in are student association,0,0.4716025486650735
3626,And for one of the tasks where we were trying to accomplish I was in charge and I thought I'd give some tasks to other members and a lot of tasks were not getting completed by the deadline that I set so um as leader to be responsible for that task I tried to figure out what was going on in the other students' lives because I was getting context and uh understanding why they were missing deadlines when we didn't have a lot of tests or homework that week,0,0.3731609464718653
3627,And through that ahem through that understanding I was able to um help motivate them to complete the tasks and resolve that conflict,0,0.04151446662050083
3628,One thing about myself,0,0.3022838906250506
3629,Interesting,1,0.9036480987850044
3630,If I was given the option to change one thing about myself yes?,0,0.3022838906250506
3631,What I would change is to uh I guess uh just generally have a lot more knowledge in my field than I than a person at my level would you know at this kind of level and that's umm that's something that would be nice,1,0.813328017108518
3632,You know I feel like I would be able to be uh much further along in my career than I am now,0,0.4295778076743686
3633,Uh huh yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
3634,Well I think I should get the job because I um have the skills necessary to complete the the task that I'll be assigned,1,0.6100299707868481
3635,Um I'm very motivated I'm always willing to learn and I I'm very passionate about learning and uh I think I'll be able to learn a lot through the position as well as contribute to the position and be able to um influence the people that I work directly with or that are shareholders in my project,1,0.7642480901805394
3636,Very well thanks,1,0.964259560652388
3637,My background,0,0.3938730607112474
3638,uh I have a fiarly technical background,0,0.3022838906250506
3639,I went to a fairly technical high school,1,0.6320398211835518
3640,Um I have mainly a mathematics and physics background with also some computer science,0,0.3572911640991484
3641,Uh I also I have been involved in leadership uh outside of outside of academics,0,0.3022838906250506
3642,So then in high school I was uh captain of my chess team and I also served as president of a couple of clubs in high school,0,0.09444753853762607
3643,So I have some some experience in that regard,0,0.1768600974688769
3644,Like I said mainly I have a pretty quantitative technical background and uh with some sprinkling of other stuff as well,1,0.5338463461786015
3645,Yes I think so because I typically think using my own mind and I act on those decisions rather than listening to what,0,0.4316075683376617
3646,uh I mean of course I take into account what,0,0.1620597888134149
3647,I think it was Lincoln who said that uh you should take into account what people tell you but then make your own decision,1,0.5978029536296913
3648,He said it more elaborately but those are the essence of what he was saying and I try to I try to to use that in every day life and in also in like important projects,0,0.4716025486650735
3649,I would say that and I I usually have I'm usually pretty successful in convincing people that my way is right when it is,1,0.7035513784479208
3650,Um yeah I think so,0,0.4316075683376617
3651,Uh when its a matter of ideology I don't like to make compromises but when it's a matter of uh getting stuff done I think that I I think that I am a team player,1,0.6100299707868481
3652,I think that uh usually I'm I'm willing to to make sacrifices if necessary for the ultimate goal,1,0.7642480901805394
3653,And so for example uh one time in high school uh we had a group project and one of the member I mean it was more complicated than I'm making it but the gist of it was that one of the members who was responsible for our data analysis he fell short he uh he we found out pretty late uh just a few days before the presentation that he had misdone most of the data analysis and as a result the rest of us but especially me because it was a group of four and we were kind of divided into two him and me and then subdivided into ones,0,0.12361406746916685
3654,So he and I were kind of a subgroup of a larger group,0,0.09444753853762607
3655,And so I was more responsible for what he had done than the other two were,0,0.09444753853762607
3656,So it was mainly me with some help from the other two,0,0.08830690875445948
3657,We had to put in a lot of work in those last few days especially me,1,0.5052336361306978
3658,I had to fix that and try to get it you know get it functional before the presentation was due,0,0.45888521649601605
3659,(One thing about myself,0,0.3022838906250506
3660,) I guess maybe being uh being more decisive on incomplete information,0,0.3937983692193587
3661,I have a tendency to try to make to try to get almost perfect information before I commit a hundred percent to a decision and of course that's never that's not always possible,1,0.7035513784479208
3662,And so I do I mean I do of course make decisions based on imperfect information every day,0,0.04151446662050083
3663,You have to otherwise you wouldn't survive,0,0.16458277299120885
3664,But I feel that you know if there is a spectrum of of how decisive you're willing to be based on a certain amount of information I think the ideal place that I would like to be is a little further toward the the decisive on incomplete information end than where I am right now,0,0.16949659631330274
3665,So I would shift that a little bit,0,0.09444753853762607
3666,ok,0,0.2387154408523499
3667,Umm I mean let's go with quantitative trading trading,0,0.3022838906250506
3668,Well I think I have the necessary skill set and the and the not the personality maybe well personality but more the uh so in terms of skill set you know it takes a very quantitative mathematical background with the ability to implement stuff uh to program and so on and I have all of that,0,0.32951325534129816
3669,It takes a lot of modelling skills,0,0.2387154408523499
3670,I have that mathematical modelling and what not,0,0.3938730607112474
3671,It also requires you to be A very competitive which I have been and B to be willing to you know to go through hell for for certain periods of time when you're either up next to a deadline or something unexpected happens and,0,0.3260083851308101
3672,So it requires you to be able to to vary the amount of time you put in usually I'll opt for the higher uh for an increased amount of time a significant bit from the average so I and I think I have a lot of experience doing that and its something that I've shown I can handle,0,0.32951325534129816
3673,Um well Im from Florida,0,0.4716025486650735
3674,I was born in Miami,0,0.3938730607112474
3675,My uh parents are from,0,0.3938730607112474
3676,I'm uh South Korean by ethnicity,0,0.3938730607112474
3677,I'd say I'm more American by heritage but uh my um parents came around here in the 80s and they settled down,0,0.21712131130422982
3678,And around I was born like around 90s I was born here in Florida,0,0.21611320583280333
3679,I had all my schooling in Florida,0,0.4730831849790573
3680,I went to home school until 7th grade then private school until I graduated,0,0.4730831849790573
3681,That's a brief synopsis of my background,0,0.3022838906250506
3682,I think I am uh just because um I have seniority maybe through sports or if it's from,1,0.6114423030620092
3683,I feel like it's hard for people not to be leaders especially when you're um assigned to do group work or you're assigned to do goal setting,1,0.5597729748834847
3684,I feel like if you're in any uh situation where you're doing goal setting you're being a leader by putting out what tasks you should do and how to execute them,1,0.7538129355606162
3685,And how you tell like you're telling yourself How am I gonna get this done,0,0.11124630256936942
3686,So like basically you're self leading,0,0.16870585012516354
3687,I believe,0,0.3938730607112474
3688,Um maybe I'd say through sports I was probably a leader,0,0.3572911640991484
3689,By um me being the upperclassman I led my teammates on,0,0.4716025486650735
3690,So I'd say yeah I've been a leader,0,0.17772661287718336
3691,Uh yes um,0,0.2387154408523499
3692,SO seeing how I rowed four years I think the biggest conflict was um when um Junior year I was rowing for Junior Eight for nationals where we were in the grand finals,0,0.19821442239249298
3693,ANd the last pentameter of the terameter (sp) race my oar popped out and we ended up actually going from third place to dead last in the grand finals,0,0.04563071281870011
3694,That was possibly the most hard experience because it made me really reevaluate what it meant for me to be rowing especially because that's something I spent four hours a day six days a week on for my entire senior um high school career and that twas something I was going to carry over through to college,0,0.07257576414901218
3695,And what really um made me realize was that yes like that was a big mistake it was just honestly it could have happened to anyone but if it weren't for some people if it weren't for just me just being just taking and it and just maturing from it I think that's like what it takes,0,0.03427685369048763
3696,If you go through something really bad but you can get stronger from it,0,0.1060810822468112
3697,You can still push something onto the table,0,0.13115931029929018
3698,Like um last last (?) year and still work hard to to really fight through it,0,0.08335277541638189
3699,You can really become great,0,0.09536317676516172
3700,And um I feel like that's what I was really working to change my view on that and um in the end we um we medaled we uh were runner ups in states,0,0.1679107013538831
3701,We medaled,0,0.33141366362000685
3702,So I think that was a good good conflict that I resolved,0,0.1352367738043197
3703,I wish I wish,0,0.4730831849790573
3704,If I could change one thing about myself I think it would be me being I think more proactive to do something,1,0.6100299707868481
3705,I'd say I wish I was more,0,0.4730831849790573
3706,I wish I was could I wish I was a little bit more volatile in things I chose actually,0,0.11220525447622531
3707,Because I feel like um I stuck to just doing crew in high school and I thought that was great but I was wondering like I wondered what would happen to me if I tried different more than one thing,0,0.3937983692193587
3708,I know I know like it's good for people to stick just to one thing and just grow in that field,1,0.6490718829987913
3709,But I always wondered I always wondered like what would happen if I pursued more toward research or more towards um club activities,0,0.1768600974688769
3710,That way I could have like a more well-rounded high school experience,0,0.4716025486650735
3711,One right now or just,0,0.39245568688584626
3712,Well I think I should have this job mainly because I find that I'm well with groups I work very well with groups,1,0.6100299707868481
3713,At the same time when you push me to do tasks myself I'm able to do the same amount be just as productive,1,0.7070690685863894
3714,I feel like um as an applicant being subject to group work and individual work um there should be no difference in how I should produce something in group work in individual work,1,0.7642480901805394
3715,I should be just as creative and innovative if I was working myself or if I was spending time working with a group of people,1,0.7035513784479208
3716,So I feel like if I was going to get this job um it would help greatly for the people I'd be working with and for myself,0,0.27356360199342006
3717,I'm fine How are you ?,1,0.6359670093958226
3718,Uhmm so I was born in uh Nigeria uh and I actually came over to the united states when I was 8 years old,0,0.12805425526188313
3719,But uh I remember science math math and science were always my best subjects,0,0.1768600974688769
3720,Uhm and I really enjoy anatomy human anatomy,0,0.23226963873358347
3721,Uhm so I think that's when i started thinking about medical field,0,0.4316075683376617
3722,Left-right?,0,0.39245568688584626
3723,I do beleive I'm a leader,0,0.4730831849790573
3724,Uhm I do beleive I take initiative a lot,0,0.3022838906250506
3725,Uhm one example that is uhm one of the student groups that I work with I work with several actually but one of uhm an example from one the one that I work,0,0.23226963873358347
3726,Um yes i do beleive I'm a team player,0,0.3022838906250506
3727,Uh another student that I work with I work with several that I can mention,0,0.4716025486650735
3728,Uhm are black student union and I'm on the executive board of for the second time this year uhm,0,0.3022838906250506
3729,If I was given one option to change one thing about myself Uh I think it would be my hesitation,0,0.4316075683376617
3730,Uhm Im pretty hesitant uhm about you know uhm first ideas or initial thoughts that I have,0,0.3260083851308101
3731,Uhm I like always have to seek like a second opinion,0,0.4716025486650735
3732,I think I should get into medical school uhm because I do believe that I will make a good doctor,1,0.7642480901805394
3733,um I'm a people person I love helping people,0,0.4716025486650735
3734,um and I love kids um I love seeing um I guess their resilience when it comes to,1,0.6100299707868481
3735,Yeah sure,0,0.2387154408523499
3736,Ummm I'm great,0,0.4716025486650735
3737,Thank you,1,0.9723827022850665
3738,OK well I am a math major but I have a lot of background in kind of different areas,0,0.1768600974688769
3739,So freshman year I did some work um at the Department of Energy um working the CFO's office so I'm getting kind of a feel for the budget um also risk matrices,0,0.10272802370478028
3740,Then I kinda branched more towards CS aspects so I did a bit of coding here and there in most research aspects and also um for companies,0,0.09444753853762607
3741,Ummm definitely,0,0.2387154408523499
3742,So I'm president of The Undergrad Society of Learner Math and this basically gives me a great opportunity to um kind of help underclassmen and also younger girls so those in highschool middle school and kind of get them to become more active in the math community um participate in more events even networking things so uh anything with companies but also research with professors,0,0.1768600974688769
3743,It's a great way to kind of help other people who haven't really seen those opportunities yet,0,0.17963402645220658
3744,Yeah soum last winter I was working in the Boston area at Autotegrity which is like a online marketing start up,0,0.4716025486650735
3745,um I don't know how much familiarity you have with um coding like repository systems but basically if someone um uploads like their work to the server and it doesn't work basically everyone elses stuff doesn't work either,1,0.5380555749984539
3746,So there's like a little column button type thing in rebuild which is called the blame button so you could kind of blame people,0,0.07772698000874113
3747,So every once in a while it would occur where someone would screw up the code and that would make everyone's work stop instead of you know blaming the one person telling them to fix the code we would all kind of look at where it went wrong and how we could improve upon that further instead of just fixing one persons code,0,0.11756413756074154
3748,So it was kind of a group effort to see how much we could all improve from the one mistake,0,0.0926304816353907
3749,I guess I would probably try to ask more questions,1,0.6114423030620092
3750,Um in general if I get directions which are really broad where I don't know where to start searching um instead of asking my higher up i would probably just automatically start looking at everything and start floating around,0,0.15856178830056442
3751,I guess it would be good to get more like to the point,0,0.4429978114195979
3752,Um like I mentioned before i think I have a good combination of leadership skills as well as um team player abilities,1,0.6100299707868481
3753,In addition to this I am pretty qualified I believe in terms of my academic classes that I have taken and also my extracurriculars have demonstrated I have a deep passion for math,0,0.4716025486650735
3754,And aside from that I have many internships which have honed my skills in the work place,0,0.1768600974688769
3755,I'm good how are you?,1,0.6359670093958226
3756,Um I'm currently a junior at MIT studying Biology,0,0.3022838906250506
3757,I'm interested in going to medical school so I'm hoping to apply to medical school my senior year and then matriculate the next year,0,0.4730831849790573
3758,Um yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
3759,Um I think I'm a leader,0,0.4316075683376617
3760,I have a lot of leadership positions so currently I am the President of the student group at MIT called the American Medical Student Association,0,0.4730831849790573
3761,So uh I help organize a lot of events for pre-meds at MIT um so as a pre-med I feel there aren't very many resources um for pre-meds,0,0.15455013832531528
3762,We have a pre-med advising office but um most students at MIT end up going into like Engineering or Research not very many go into medicine,1,0.5052336361306978
3763,So um we provide a lot of um outside activities for pre-meds,0,0.1066093052570166
3764,Uh our main one is um lecture series so we often ask Doctors from nearby hospitals to come speak about like what they do,1,0.5671518808090605
3765,Sure um so um as part of the 'American Medical Student Association' uh last year we started a brand new event um it was a 5k run to benefit the Austins Childrens Hospital,1,0.5052336361306978
3766,And since it was our first time planning such a large event we had a lot of trouble um like communicating between team members and distributing um what like clearly stating what each person should do and what their responsibilities were,0,0.11581967354018562
3767,Um to fix that I think we had to like I had to call like an Executive meeting,1,0.7120528119563496
3768,So we have an Exec Board and then uh I made sure that everyone knew clearly what they were supposed to do and made sure they finished what they had to do by a certain date,0,0.30353397813348454
3769,Hmm that's tough,0,0.39245568688584626
3770,(Laughter) Um I think the main thing I would try to change is um getting nervous in front of strangers or being shy um I used to um get really shy when like public speaking for example speaking in front of a lot of people and I've been trying to improve that,0,0.1804648747309403
3771,Um but I think it would be nice if I could be more but like there is still room for improvement,0,0.27356360199342006
3772,Uh my passion is helping people,0,0.4716025486650735
3773,So I have a lot of I've been doing a lot of volunteer activities um I've been volunteering at hospitals I've been volunteering at Brooks I bring them to the Womens Hospital in Boston and MEPS General Hospital,0,0.09444753853762607
3774,I've also been volunteering through the Cambridge Community Centers I used to tutor young children how to read and I'm currently an AP Biology Teacher for um students in the Boston area who want to take AP Biology but can't,0,0.4730831849790573
3775,Um so I really enjoy helping people uh and I think medicine is one of the best ways to help people because everyone gets sick and uh I mean once your health is gone you can't really do anything so,0,0.22322479893436015
3776,I'm doing very well today,1,0.5724056014340263
3777,Thanks,1,0.929060350894491
3778,How are you?,0,0.15445987288440202
3779,I'm currently a Junior here at MIT and I'm pursing a double major in Computer Science and Management um the reason for that is that I actually fell in love with um the merging of computer science with a lot of other fields and I found that management is a way to take computer science and the theories of algorithms and problem solving and taking it to a wider field which is exactly why I'm interested in consulting is again its the idea of taking problem solving and algorithms and applying it to a lot of different problems and always trying new things and I'm very excited about that and that's where I'm coming from,0,0.05898187383578916
3780,I do,0,0.3938730607112474
3781,Um I'm actually a part of the Gordan Engineering leadership program here at MIT which students are chosen through an application process to be a part of this program and in this program um we work on engineering leadership labs which is um they give us scenarios which we might encounter in the real world and we take the position of a leader and kind of get to step through it and I've gotten very positive feedback from my group every time about how I've handled those,0,0.12871674455088036
3782,In addition in um various activities I'm involved in on campus I have had a leadership role in many of those and again I've gotten very positive feedback from the people I've worked with so I think those put together mean not only have I had the experience to be a leader but I've also had positive feedback that I am succeeding at that,0,0.27356360199342006
3783,Definitely! Um I was on the committee that designed our class ring so at MIT each year there's a new class ring designed specifically for that year and the idea is that it enco,0,0.4064865837293959
3784,encompasses aspects of all different fractions of student life so this committee is made up of a very diverse group of people,0,0.2387154408523499
3785,And um there were some features on the ring which we would become very divided on and there few ah divisions within campus which kind of became clear on our team so people would kind of polarize based on which side of the campus fraction they lived on and then it would kind of get a little bit hostile and people would say this is relevant no it's not relevant um and I kind of became the peace keeper um where I would kind of go between those sides try to find the mutually agreeable thing maybe like if someone really wanted something on the ring and someone else didn't I would suggest maybe we could make it smaller or have it somewhere else so if it was on the ring but not so blatantly obvious that the people who didn't relate to it thought it was too focal so I became kind of the unofficial go between who would hear both sides kind of impartially and put things together,0,0.07732075106804231
3786,and I had about 2 to 3 people afterwards tell me that we wouldn't have gotten to where we did without my peacekeeping,0,0.14153925129016182
3787,I think I would know my limits a little bit better,1,0.5737824960575687
3788,Um in that sense I like I mentioned with the computer science and management I get excited in a lot of different areas and I really want to try doing everything that excites me and I really give it my all but as a result being involved with a lot of different things means that at times I very tired because I'm trying to do a lot so I think I would recognize when I'm hitting that point and scale back a little bit um that said I've been trying to work on that a bit this year and kind of pick my top activities and cut down to those so it is something I'm working on,0,0.05034229212330959
3789,I think aside from my background which is as I mentioned very ah relevant to consulting with the library and gym applications um as we've talked about I'm very much a team player I'm very excited about the work that you do um I absolutely love all the different aspects I've talked to a lot of people in the company and I've really liked what they've said about the company culture it makes me very excited and those are all values I struggle and relate to so in addition to the expertise I think I would be a great fit,0,0.48491442283001573
3790,Good,1,0.9036480987850044
3791,I study ocean engineering at MIT,0,0.3938730607112474
3792,I’m a junior and I’m really interested in building robots to use in the ocean,0,0.23333067621579343
3793,Like this summer I worked on an underwater vehicle to look at sea ice in Antarctica,0,0.4716025486650735
3794,Yes I believe I’m a leader,0,0.3022838906250506
3795,Right now um one of my main leadership initiatives is restarting the Society of Naval Architects Submarine Engineers at MIT,0,0.4716025486650735
3796,And that’s a group of all the ocean engineers studying at MIT including undergrads and grad-students,0,0.07018898356424853
3797,And um I’m working with other students to organize dinners with professors and outings with with students interested in engineering from other schools and departments,0,0.09444753853762607
3798,Yes I’d say I’m a team player,0,0.3022838906250506
3799,Uhm this this term I’m working on a team for one of my classes,0,0.3022838906250506
3800,A team of about seven people and we’re building er manufacturing a hundred yo-yos together and um it’s actually complicated to manufacture one yo-yo if you’re doing everything from scratch like the molds the plastic the process times you figuring out which missions you want to use,0,0.15796148039797941
3801,And um we’ve done a yo-yo we decided to divide our team into um groups of two people and each set of two people works on one part of the yo-yo so we have four parts,0,0.19732153176187164
3802,And we were having a problem just last week when we needed to fill out a report about our yo-yos but two teams hadn’t finished their part yet because they couldn’t um get time in the mission shop so we decided to resolve that by we talked to the professor I was the person who talked to the professor and asked for an extension on the report and told him what was happening,0,0.06408131848943939
3803,Uhm we got the extention and anyway if we wrote the report except missing the information from those two parts and then the team working on those two parts is going to fill it in this week,0,0.33141366362000685
3804,Let’s see,0,0.2387154408523499
3805,Sometimes I would like to be more comfortable with my voice,1,0.5338463461786015
3806,Like speaking louder and more confidently,0,0.2115156921086478
3807,Sometimes like when I go back home I pick up this southern accent again,1,0.5338463461786015
3808,My family lives in D,0,0.3938730607112474
3809,but a lot are from the south and they speak with the twang so when I came home for Thanksgiving I had this southern twang,0,0.09444753853762607
3810,Oh it sounded different and people were a little bit confused and then I went into this middle stage now I’m back to where I am now,0,0.04151446662050083
3811,Maybe speaking a little bit more quieter but without the accent,0,0.45321313756248316
3812,So I need to find out where my voice is,0,0.09444753853762607
3813,Uhm I am a really hard worker I’m very organized I’m comfortable working with teams,0,0.11161482957460721
3814,I’m also on a sealing team which is another part of a team that I’m involved on,0,0.4730831849790573
3815,Um I’m passionate about what I do and I can bring a lot of engineering expertise and knowledge into the group,0,0.4716025486650735
3816,Great hahaha,1,0.9036480987850044
3817,More about my backround well,0,0.4716025486650735
3818,I'm from Canada but I grew up in South Florida because you know one day my parents just decided that it was too cold,0,0.3273150694050083
3819,Yes,0,0.2387154408523499
3820,Because umm everything I try to do I you know always try to do the best that I can and even if I'm not the best at it that-- the effort like that alone should be enough to sort of inspire somebody even if they're better at it than I am you know,1,0.5991253810632329
3821,I find that's inspiring you know seeing someone try you know and trying their hardest,1,0.6359670093958226
3822,And maybe they're not the best at it but you know the effort that they put into something is sort of something to be looked high upon so,0,0.2066034157898696
3823,Umm hmmm,0,0.2387154408523499
3824,I wish I was taller,0,0.4730831849790573
3825,Heh ha because I've been working my but off,0,0.3022838906250506
3826,Um so I was born in Japan um where I lived for seven years,0,0.3022838906250506
3827,After that I moved to uh the U,0,0.3022838906250506
3828,when I was around seven or eight years old,0,0.3572911640991484
3829,Uh first to Michigan for a couple of years from two to three and then to Maryland um and it was in Maryland that I started middle school,0,0.3022838906250506
3830,And it was through middle school and high school that I was exposed to above average and advanced courses in science math and uh programming,0,0.1768600974688769
3831,I was competing with I think the best in the state and probably best in the nation taking math competitions just doing a lot of science competitions in general,1,0.7642480901805394
3832,Um junior year of high school uh because of peer and parental pressures I decided to go into premed,0,0.3022838906250506
3833,And I decided to take consequently decided to take some bio classes uh a lot of cell physiology genetics psychology,0,0.09444753853762607
3834,And when I got here at MIT uh well logically I decided to major in course twenty bio engineering,0,0.1768600974688769
3835,Um and to just to follow that track I decided to take a couple decided to do a couple internships in labs four labs actually two in academia here at MIT actually and I realized that uh the positions weren't fast paced and weren't competitive enough or quantitative enough for that matter so I decided to go into industry hoping that would satisfy my requirements I guess,0,0.34651595146154224
3836,And again it was fun I learned a lot but it was just uh it didn't have the skill set requirements that I wanted,0,0.1768600974688769
3837,Uh but it was um my last internship I had the opportunity to talk with several directors managers people on the business side I realized that could be something that I want to do,0,0.3022838906250506
3838,That could be more appropriate for me for my career,0,0.4716025486650735
3839,Um afterward I talked to a lot of my finance colleagues started taking finance classes went to workshops started networking and I realized you know this is most likely what I want to do,0,0.4204536666629771
3840,I talked to several people who wanted to go into trading and they gave me some interview questions and I said you know what that's exactly the kind of questions that I want to tackle on a daily basis,1,0.5395318149680698
3841,And so that's why I'm here,0,0.09444753853762607
3842,Do I think I'm a leader? I believe so,1,0.6114423030620092
3843,And this is I say so because of several reasons,0,0.09444753853762607
3844,One is from just from personal experience in the past,0,0.2387154408523499
3845,I've uh worked in teams Ive met teams a few in high school and a few in college and I think I work well with others,1,0.7642480901805394
3846,But not only that people trust me,0,0.13457995866975905
3847,I am able to divide up a huge project break it down into small sub-projects and uh give assign these tasks to different people without uh any complaints without too much complaints,0,0.21250816544335416
3848,I think I have some leaderships skills uh as you can see from my resume if (inaudible mumbling),0,0.4602829865210856
3849,I do consider myself a team player,0,0.4730831849790573
3850,I'd like to give a good example,1,0.5724056014340263
3851,In my sophomore year in high school I worked with this project called Mission Impossible or Mission Possible sorry and the goal of the project was to design a rover from scratch that would traverse a platform and record data send it over to the computer and the computer will create a 3D graph a 3D replica of the terrain,1,0.834740328321388
3852,And we were graded on how precise and accurate how similar the 3D terrain was to the actual terrain,0,0.19732153176187164
3853,And there were many parts to the project one was the construction of the actual rover,0,0.07018898356424853
3854,The other was the programming,0,0.2387154408523499
3855,Making us write the source code,0,0.33141366362000685
3856,Third one was making the terrain,0,0.2387154408523499
3857,The forth one was integrating everything together,0,0.2387154408523499
3858,There were five group members there were only four tasks,0,0.2387154408523499
3859,I was picked to be I guess the group leader so I assigned the tasks,1,0.6114423030620092
3860,I made sure everything integrated correctly,1,0.5724056014340263
3861,And it's not a small task but uh it definitely gave me some experience,0,0.07018898356424853
3862,I think one of the problems was because this was a four week long project this was a four week long project but we didn't get much done until the third or forth week because things just didn't integrate correctly,1,0.6063387593691233
3863,There weren't communications there weren't assigned tasks there just wasn't teamwork,0,0.2387154408523499
3864,There just wasn't the synergy that was required for us in order for us to finish this project,0,0.33141366362000685
3865,And during the third week I was appointed the captain I gave tasks,0,0.09444753853762607
3866,I made sure every part was compatible,1,0.5724056014340263
3867,I made sure that everybody knew what everybody else was doing and in the end we completed the project successfully,1,0.6790936156954253
3868,Well as you can see from my resume my biggest weakness I think is my lack of formal training in finance,0,0.4588075285625812
3869,Uh I'm not a course fifteen finance or management major or a course fourteen economics major,0,0.3022838906250506
3870,I don't have any form of work experience I don't work in a big bank or investment company or a proprietary trading firm,0,0.43441758665660263
3871,But I can tell you that I have taken more initiative I've been more proactive in the last year in terms of looking for ways to combat to overcome my weakness,0,0.10429856273872934
3872,I've gone to network sessions I've actually set up to quit my sports team so I could go to these network sections info sessions workshops because unfortunately team practice was always between five and seven and that was also the period in which info sessions were held,0,0.11220525447622531
3873,I did my research I've gone online and went to your company website I know exactly who you guys and what you're looking for I know exactly what my role will be,1,0.5395318149680698
3874,I don't have any false expectations about my job,0,0.271587471786791
3875,And after knowing everything I am still very very very interested in the position,0,0.09444753853762607
3876,Well I I think my answer to the past question about uh how I overcame at my weakness how one of my strength is my quantitative competitive and fast paced abilities and the fact that I don't have any false expectations I know exactly what I want to do I know exactly what you want from me,0,0.4588075285625812
3877,And those are very good reasons like they apply to this,0,0.13457995866975905
3878,And I would also like to compare myself with the rest competition and tell you that I have more I don't think there's anybody else with the same kind of technical strength technical expertise that I have um even uh most students here at MIT,0,0.32951325534129816
3879,Good! How are you?,1,0.8452898993011722
3880,Um so I'm a junior at MIT studying computer science and molecular biology,0,0.3022838906250506
3881,Um most of my background is in biology,0,0.3022838906250506
3882,I did research for about a year and a half at a lab here at MIT in just basic molecular biology,0,0.3938730607112474
3883,Um but I'm also involved in a couple student groups on campus,0,0.3022838906250506
3884,One of them I was previously involved in MIT Fighting World Hunger so we did a lot of charity work with local and international hunger issues and trying to learn more about the issues,0,0.3694476305055536
3885,And right now I've devoted all of my time to a different organization called GlobeMed at MIT and we basically our partner is a nonprofit organization abroad and we do work to improve HIV healthcare services in Togo which is in Africa,0,0.25353811833686407
3886,Most people don't know where that is so,0,0.2387154408523499
3887,I think uh if I'm not now I think I have the potential to be one,1,0.6114423030620092
3888,Um I still consider myself immature as in I'm still a student but I think I have been given a couple of leadership positions that I've grown a lot from um and I think if I was given if I was put in a different situation I could adapt to it,0,0.0705571610152508
3889,Um would you like an example of a,1,0.801210552340393
3890,Um so uh I'm co-president of the organization I just mentioned GlobeMed at MIT,0,0.3022838906250506
3891,And we uh basically are in charge me and my fellow co-president are in charge of about 30 other members,0,0.14153925129016182
3892,Um and this involves a lot of coordination among teams that we have split,0,0.17070910373751436
3893,We've organized our organization into different teams and we've got like campaigns which is like fundraising team and we've got communications is like publicity finances and community building and these are all like split up at the same time we also have to maintain contact with our partner organization abroad in Togo,0,0.2977831921157918
3894,Um so we do a lot with like non-profit business as well as marketing but also sort of try to appeal to the undergraduate population in terms of fundraising but also awareness,1,0.5052336361306978
3895,So it's kind of pretty multi faceted I think I've done a lot in terms of building up this organization it started from scratch essentially so,0,0.24476056556419554
3896,And if you wanted examples of leaderships I guess I could,0,0.19261288316730724
3897,the only objective thing would be like what we've accomplished so far would that be interesting to you?,1,0.5713018750224388
3898,Um so uh so we started this year essentially and we were able to secure a lot of sponsorships from different companies such as City Sports Dunkin Donuts Copy Tech as well as MIT sponsorships like the public service center where they would give us about $3000 to do our project in January in Togo,1,0.5671518808090605
3899,And an MIT office donated 62 laptops just this last week,0,0.07018898356424853
3900,So I think like we've been definitely doing well like getting our name out there and also um achieving what we've set out to do which is improve healthcare,0,0.3731609464718653
3901,Um well the project hasn't essentially started but our mission was to provide technology to improve clinical efficiency there,1,0.5671518808090605
3902,So um having our first step sort of been made by securing these donations I think is a good step of us showing that we have been succeeding objectively but but yeah,0,0.3731609464718653
3903,Um yes so I do think I've definitely learned a lot from this experiment experience to become more of a team player,0,0.4316075683376617
3904,And I think I uh I know what it takes to be a good team player by seeing what doesn't work what does work qualities that I don't think work in other members in interactions that I've had,0,0.43832997198318147
3905,So an example would be uh last year when GlobeMed first started I wasn't the co-president but we had a set of co-presidents who were also starting out,0,0.14153925129016182
3906,So to be fair it was a totally new concept new organization and it's their downfall is they weren't that motivated,0,0.060661407047331486
3907,They didn't really seem to care that much about the outcome of our organization,0,0.14385601394430575
3908,And for me and other members that really devoted ourselves to it it really frustrated us um but we had to learn how to be team players in the sense that we couldn't just go out and do everything ourselves and risk stepping on their toes,0,0.016520536803682564
3909,We had to respect their position as our bosses essentially,1,0.5671518808090605
3910,And this definitely was difficult in a lot of ways I think I learned that you have to know your bounds and know that you can't achieve everything,0,0.0901395103829997
3911,You can't always just brute force your way through things,0,0.07562510044038717
3912,I think that um it's always the best way if you ever feel like any conflict is about to arise or if you feel uncomfortable at something like immediately schedule a time to meet with that person just talk it out completely respectfully without approaching a bunch of people and asking what they think,1,0.5597729748834847
3913,It's just probably better to meet face to face with that person and settle it from the start,0,0.45321313756248316
3914,And then you know if things don't improve after that there may be other things you can do involving other members but I think it's best just face to face yeah so much of our world is like by e-mail nowadays so yeah,0,0.43722042557844615
3915,In terms of leadership? Or anything?,0,0.07018898356424853
3916,Oh,0,0.2387154408523499
3917,Hm,0,0.2387154408523499
3918,Well my joke would be I wish I was taller but hahaha,0,0.2704138274778955
3919,Well I wish I was more I guess I would change my like time management skills,1,0.6100299707868481
3920,Because I think I definitely am not as efficient as I'd like to be right now especially as a student,1,0.6100299707868481
3921,Um I think I spend a lot of time on Facebook,0,0.4316075683376617
3922,I do a lot of networking which I think I justify to myself like 'Oh that's good for future endeavors ' but I really think I like I could be more efficient in terms of like you know my free time in the summer like learn a new programming language,0,0.25663342630896147
3923,Like that could be that's always something I wanted to do but never end up doing,0,0.4716025486650735
3924,So so yeah I would probably change that,0,0.16717103800329672
3925,Uh I think I'm very like motivated,1,0.6100299707868481
3926,I think because I know how to act as a leader of a group,1,0.6114423030620092
3927,I may not be the most experienced in software development since I just started the major,1,0.5353244206591785
3928,I think I can direct a team of people very diverse from me and working very different from me because I think I'm a very vocal person,1,0.6114423030620092
3929,I think I communicate well uh with people or attemptfully,1,0.7642480901805394
3930,And I think that can be useful when it's a team,0,0.27356360199342006
3931,And I think software development like a lot of people think like it's just one person in a group programming but I think it really involves a lot of coordination among the team,0,0.11320191250810435
3932,I think I can contribute that way,1,0.6114423030620092
3933,I’m doing well thank you,1,0.9864801121167501
3934,“Laughs” O ok,0,0.2387154408523499
3935,Umm,0,0.2387154408523499
3936,My name is Victoria Mcray (sp) and I’m an Aerospace Engineer at MIT,0,0.4730831849790573
3937,I am a Junior and I’m in NRTC (sp) witch is a Naval training program that you take during college to commission as an officer,1,0.5395318149680698
3938,I would say I am a leader in training at this moment,0,0.4730831849790573
3939,Umm through ROTC I am put in leadership rolls reach semester,0,0.3022838906250506
3940,Which help ahh build the skills towards becoming a leader,0,0.2387154408523499
3941,Umm last semester I was a squad leader in ROTC…,0,0.3022838906250506
3942,… which is where you lead about “coughs” six to eight people umm and you all have to work as a unit to earn ahh honor squad at the end of semester,0,0.45741044182905144
3943,Which is dependent on upon umm our PT scores which we have competitive… PT being Physical Training umm…,1,0.5052336361306978
3944,…we have different physical competitions each week,0,0.33141366362000685
3945,We also have Naval Knowledge quizzes etcetera in working together,0,0.33141366362000685
3946,Umm and we had sometimes the freshman are a little umm getting use to it a little slower in to getting to the…,0,0.20894356666517588
3947,…swing of things,0,0.2387154408523499
3948,Umm and we have this one who is having issues with PT so I helped have extra sessions to help umm do more physical fitness and…,0,0.3694476305055536
3949,…ended up doing a lot better towards the end,0,0.39245568688584626
3950,My command presence,0,0.3938730607112474
3951,Meaning umm sometimes I’m more quite and its something I think it over and not be as shy about when I talk to others and to feel confident when I know something,1,0.6100299707868481
3952,Umm in order to fix this I often put myself out there and try and “coughs” not hide in the corner,0,0.3572911640991484
3953,“laughs” umm I’ve wanted to be a naval fighter pilot for a very very long time and I have been taking steps to go beyond umm,0,0.3022838906250506
3954,I’m going to be taking ground school next semester and aerospace engineering umm and I’ve gone flying a few times and I think that through ROTC and my own experiences I will be a good candidate for a fighter pilot in the Navy,1,0.7642480901805394
3955,I'm good,1,0.5724056014340263
3956,Okay so I was born in Irvine California um where I lived for about ten years,0,0.3022838906250506
3957,And um my parents and I actually moved back to Taiwan um at that point,0,0.03414728906078335
3958,So I went to an international school there,0,0.09444753853762607
3959,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
3960,It was mostly English speaking but outside of school I would often speak Mandarin also with a couple of friends um as well as you know just getting by in the outside world,1,0.5991253810632329
3961,Yeah and so yeah so when I was after high school I decided to apply to colleges in the U,0,0.09444753853762607
3962,Um just because I was more interested in living here and working here in the future,0,0.3022838906250506
3963,So yep applied to a couple of different schools,0,0.07018898356424853
3964,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
3965,Choosing ending up choosing MIT,0,0.2387154408523499
3966,Um I would say that in terms of leadership style I would not consider myself a like a born leader,0,0.4716025486650735
3967,Um that said I do think that I am um my leadership style comes mostly from mediating things,0,0.4316075683376617
3968,Um I tend to be very you know I am really good at stepping back um and looking at a situation um as a big picture,0,0.28306467931876694
3969,I think using that while I don't necessarily you know take the center stage all the time and you know and stand up and you know order people around or anything like that,1,0.8088170427287866
3970,In that respect I feel like I can I can usually end up managing um different groups of people very well in a very um mediatory kind of manner,1,0.6100299707868481
3971,Absolutely yeah I definitely do consider myself a team player,0,0.4730831849790573
3972,And um an example I can tell you about is I actually work as an EMT um so an Emergency Medical Technician here on campus,0,0.03797263861152235
3973,And we have different um ranks within our crew so currently I am a second rider which means that there's there's usually somebody above me and as well as somebody below me in a single crew,0,0.30353397813348454
3974,And so one case was we were dispatched to a patient who had chest pains,0,0.0926304816353907
3975,And so we didn't know anything about this patient until we got there,0,0.19732153176187164
3976,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
3977,But when we did um mostly the crew chief the person above me and I were discussing you know what could potentially be the underlying problem,0,0.10286015982892119
3978,And you know we kind of disagreed on that initially um because my crew chief um talked about mentioned that you know it could be a cardio problem,0,0.08202498503907435
3979,So that um I think was was the was the root cause of the problem,0,0.0705571610152508
3980,And um I think that that was something that you know was something very important because um to to the care of the patient as we went down the line,0,0.43722042557844615
3981,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
3982,If I had the option to change one thing about myself,0,0.3022838906250506
3983,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
3984,I think that I would definitely choose to make myself more confident,1,0.7642480901805394
3985,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
3986,Mostly as a speaker I tend to be I tend to get um pretty nervous as yeah when I have to speak in front of large groups of people,0,0.32230062042973917
3987,Um and I have worked on that,0,0.4716025486650735
3988,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
3989,Both as an EMT you know you have to really work on your confidence so that you know your patients trust you a little bit more,0,0.22225047449424434
3990,Um and also as leaders of different groups on campus,0,0.07018898356424853
3991,Um such as I'm leader of MIT Met Life as well as the Association of Taiwanese Students,0,0.4716025486650735
3992,So you know in the various uh clubs and groups that I am involved in across campus I've definitely had to I've definitely been using those opportunities to work on um you know giving myself opportunities to speak onstage in front of large groups of people,0,0.21899413203219753
3993,Okay,0,0.2387154408523499
3994,There are a couple of reasons I think I should get into medical school,0,0.4316075683376617
3995,Number one I have a great deal of experience um in clinical fields as well as research,0,0.4716025486650735
3996,I work in a hematology lab here on campus,1,0.5724056014340263
3997,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
3998,I've been working here for about a year already,0,0.3938730607112474
3999,Um and yeah I really really enjoy the process of you know going through the scientific investigation process as well as you know it gives you a lot of a lot of joy when you figure out,0,0.12477375645215281
4000,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
4001,Whether or not something works,0,0.39245568688584626
4002,And um so I mentioned before also that I work as an EMT so I so beyond having the scientific background I also have a little bit of clinical background,0,0.1768600974688769
4003,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
4004,You know being able to manage patients and to talk to them,0,0.13115931029929018
4005,And I think that's that's you know a crucial component of being a doctor as well,0,0.32951325534129816
4006,But lastly I have a great deal of passion for the medical field,0,0.1768600974688769
4007,And um I hope that what I what I ultimately learn in medical school will give me I think the you know the opportunity to make a great difference in the medical field,0,0.32951325534129816
4008,Pretty good how was yours?,0,0.45741044182905144
4009,Yeah it's uh it's been rather pleasant,0,0.45321313756248316
4010,I thought it was gonna snow today,1,0.532476616497347
4011,Sure! Uh so I am an MIT Junior,0,0.3022838906250506
4012,Originally I was uh a freshman at Michigan and then I transferred to uh MIT for my sophomore year,0,0.3022838906250506
4013,Um thank you I'm studying uh Computer Science and uh I guess I didn't really get into computer science until last year um or last summer er the summer before my sophomore year and then um ever since I've more or less committed to it wholly and every minute to,1,0.9665576978061874
4014,Um I think in some respects I can be a leader but I wouldn't say like in everything I do I'm a leader so um in certain activities that I take part in I definitely step up to a leadership position in certain situations but I don't tend to try to be a leader all the time--,0,0.27356360199342006
4015,--because I do like to listen to feedback and I like more of a group contribution as opposed to like a single person leading all tasks but like I remember doing a team exercise once where uh like lowering a Hula Hoop down with everyone's hands um,0,0.1768600974688769
4016,when you have a group of people in a circle and we realized that you needed to have someone sort of spearhead the the operation there otherwise like everyone's trying to do their own thing and so there are it's mainly in those situations that I'll try to step up but most of the time I I don't like to be too controlling,0,0.3625540296374043
4017,Oh definitely! Um,0,0.2387154408523499
4018,Sure um,0,0.2387154408523499
4019,So uh I guess that was one example of a challenge uh that we handle as a team but um let's see,0,0.22419003988946132
4020,Ok so um last year I was pledging at my fraternity and we one of the activities we do as a pledge or as pledges is um organize the formal for in the Fall so uh we're just given a budget and general guidelines for what a formal should consist of and then we we're tasked with setting up everything,0,0.08075960328395453
4021,So um in this situation like all the 21 pledges uh we got together and we allocated tasks and um obviously when you have a large event like this with so many people where they get together to bring in to make it happen you need to sort of uh there are certain people who won't do their jobs and so um part of what we did was just have this sort of setup of accountability where you know more or less one pledge would check on another group of pledges to make sure that they were getting their task done and if they needed to help them out and so and this way we try to have somewhat decentralized leadership but still um manage to pull off yeah,0,0.29160838405168515
4022,Um let's see if I could change one thing?,0,0.3022838906250506
4023,I would probably make myself slightly less of a procrastinator,1,0.5353244206591785
4024,I um I have a tendency to like when I have a lot of free time uh to to work on something I don't get started I don't make as much headway initially as I probably could or should,1,0.7035513784479208
4025,Um and tend um in that respect leave it it's more like my work is more weighted towards the latter half of the deadline and so um I think just in terms of meeting my own goals like uh organizations that I get involved with projects it it would just be more productive to to be working uh full speed the entire time,1,0.6100299707868481
4026,Sure,0,0.2387154408523499
4027,Um ok so a job that I'd like to have is uh software engineering role at uh a tech company or something,0,0.4716025486650735
4028,Uh and um I think I am a good fit for the job because I have a pretty strong background in computer programming skill sets for this position um I've been taking various computer science classes at MIT and engineering classes and learning uh the proper was,1,0.6100299707868481
4029,Uh not THE proper ways but um good problem solving skills and ways to approach and ways to approach um hard problems and um that's I think those are skills that are not difficult not overly difficult to acquire but most many people do not acquire them in uh the engineering education,0,0.3937983692193587
4030,Oh good,0,0.39245568688584626
4031,Um So my name is Andre uh I come from Finland I've studied for two years at Cambridge University in England umm where I did all sorts of engineering for the first two years but I chose to specialize in electrical engineering and information technologies,0,0.09444753853762607
4032,Um Currently I'm on an exchange year abroad to MIT doing Course 6,0,0.3022838906250506
4033,And at MIT I'm specializing in artificial intelligence -- machine learning (score vector?) machines -- and also device physics and some digital electronics,0,0.1768600974688769
4034,Um Specifically in the area of device physics and digital electronics I'm looking at risk processors as well as um nanot- um micro- and nanoscale uh semiconductor devices such as transistors uhh specifically ballistic transistors which operate at the smallest possible unit,0,0.10272802370478028
4035,Em so yeah,0,0.07018898356424853
4036,Uhh In the area of AI I have undertaken uh certain competitions uh which I have been uh lucky to win,0,0.4716025486650735
4037,Um in the first one I had to write a simulator where um I wrote an AI to control a spacecraft which is --,0,0.3022838906250506
4038,-- supposed to be able to land and take off from Mars,0,0.2869118389241647
4039,And during that I had to take into account planetary rotation gravity atmospheric effects uh aerobraking and all those things so it was a pretty complex AI to be able to handle all of that,0,0.08191717026182452
4040,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
4041,Also I undertook a competition uh at Cambridge,0,0.3022838906250506
4042,Uhh in a team of six we had to build an autonomous robot which was able to navigate a grid and pick up an object and put it in a in the appropriate box,0,0.2977831921157918
4043,And there I um was a a team lead where I managed the team until it did the tasks,0,0.1768600974688769
4044,And also I wrote the AI for that,0,0.09444753853762607
4045,Um I think I have pretty good leadership qualities umm mainly because I'm able to think uhh on a lo- longer scale like what has to get accomplished uhh and be able to delegate tasks to people to achieve intermediate goal which will be kind of modular to the achievement of the uhhh long term goal,1,0.6100299707868481
4046,So for example in the the um robotics project we had- our our ultimate goal was to build a chassis build an electronics build an AI and have the robot win this competition,0,0.19732153176187164
4047,But uhhh we- we didn't go from like scrap metal to that in one go,0,0.0926304816353907
4048,We had to uh we had to look at um specifically first I had to write an AI which was uh straight - the bit of a AI which was able to follow white lines on a black surface um and turn on the- uh at the junctions of those lines,0,0.4064865837293959
4049,Um The electronics guys to that end had to uh make some circuits which uhh connect the um infrared light form sensors to the kind of main CPU the arm-core CPU,0,0.2387154408523499
4050,Umm So there was some circuit elements involved,0,0.2387154408523499
4051,And the uh mechanics guys had to pretty much just make a test chassis for us um but all that took some organizing because they were busy in the workshops so they didn't have much time to screw arou -- to uh play around with um,0,0.23979299191356468
4052,you know other uh other things and the electronics guys had to um also schedule the time correctly,0,0.2372142273492121
4053,Um So one of the challenges in the robotics competition and this specific team was that um we often had to share resources which were limited among other teams and also among the people in the team,0,0.20894356666517588
4054,Um For -- One of the resources if I may say so which had to be shared in in our team was myself because I ha--,0,0.4677438674270065
4055,uhh I was a bit of the project lead so I had to give some advice and also umm sort out some technical points with both the electronics and the mechanics teams and also I had to write my own AI so I had to kind of balance between the uh two and kind of manage my time,0,0.1768600974688769
4056,So what I would try to do was I would tell them uh that we would work out some sort of specific issue of like sensor connections with the electrical uh team and I would say Okay guys so you're going to build this now and How long is this going to take? and they would say I don't know it's going to take us uh a couple hours,0,0.07593192749218049
4057,And then I would have the time to maybe for half an hour go down to the workshop where the mechanical team are playing around and I would talk to them and see you know what they're doing and how- how far apart they want the wheels or something uh for the you know for the touring to be efficient or where do you want the balance because uh we faced an an issue: if we put too much um weight on the back of the robot the robot might tip over,0,0.19106454292257607
4058,So we try uhhh we have to you know uh fix that issue,0,0.06074309713506123
4059,But uh once I had the two teams working uh I was able to go back and quickly um write some code,0,0.09444753853762607
4060,So the issue was that I needed to kind of give advice from time to time,0,0.04151446662050083
4061,Umm and I think I did that by delegating tasks pretty well,1,0.6100299707868481
4062,Um I think I would try to become more succinct in how I speak and more engaging to people because often I find that umm I come off sometimes a bit geeky or dorky and some people might not take to that a-- as easily,1,0.6100299707868481
4063,And --,0,0.07018898356424853
4064,-- as a team lead you have to be both inspiring and charismatic,0,0.45741044182905144
4065,Um I mean some uhhh some great examples I mean I guess as a cliche it's kind of like Steve Jobs where he's uh amazingly inspiring he's very good at talking to people but he's also um like I wouldn't be able to say that he's kind of more (adducent?) to,0,0.24476056556419554
4066,While at the same time he is quite you know quite the geek being you know uh in charge of Apple and you know thinking about how to play with all these (unintelligible),0,0.17901834688044663
4067,toys,0,0.2387154408523499
4068,So striking a balance like that where you kind of you're kind of able to have the fun with the tech and also be uh kind of serious,0,0.16870585012516354
4069,um but not boring-serious um so I try to strive towards that direction uh if I could,0,0.15248303418968046
4070,Um I think that being a project lead in a robotics design team or a like an electronic product design team uhh would be really great fun especially if I was also able to participate in the technical side and not only the managerial side,0,0.34651595146154224
4071,Umm because being on the managerial side would allow me to uh kind of be able to set the the direction uh in some way which I enjoy doing and also manage the kind of uh the sub-teams and how things will get done,0,0.4716025486650735
4072,But at the same time being on the technical side it's just fun to play around with all this really cool tech and build it especially it's quite rewarding,0,0.06335330817101623
4073,Um so I think I have the technical background for the technical part,0,0.4316075683376617
4074,Um I've I've done my programming I've done my AI - AI courses my electronics courses so I so I know that pretty well,0,0.1768600974688769
4075,And I have the experience um of working in a team and being a team lead uhh to know how to manage a small but efficient team,0,0.1768600974688769
4076,Thank you,1,0.9723827022850665
4077,Um so I'm obviously not from the States as the accent gives away,0,0.3022838906250506
4078,I'm from a smallish town called Carifargus near Belfast in Northern Ireland,0,0.21250816544335416
4079,I just went to a local primary school there which is the equivalent of elementary school um for people this side of the pond,0,0.3938730607112474
4080,Uh and then like a local high school and uh was encouraged to within a year to consider applying to Cambridge which was something I hadn't really thought was something appropiate for me,0,0.34651595146154224
4081,I kind of just envisaged going to one of the Northern Irish universities maybe one of the Scottish ones,0,0.45468571979582034
4082,Um so I applied to Cambridge and luckily they seemed to think that I was suitable,1,0.5338463461786015
4083,So I've spent the last two years um there studying engineering,0,0.09444753853762607
4084,And then the opportunity came up to spend my junior year here in the States,0,0.09444753853762607
4085,So I went for that immediately,0,0.09444753853762607
4086,Um I've been moving into specialism of aerospace engineering,0,0.3022838906250506
4087,That should be good fun,0,0.45321313756248316
4088,And was as Fenway Park I think in my second week here or something,0,0.15455013832531528
4089,A Red Sox game so,0,0.2387154408523499
4090,Immersing myself in the American culture,0,0.3022838906250506
4091,Definitely enjoying my time here,0,0.4716025486650735
4092,Um yes I think that I have the self-confidence to be a leader,1,0.6100299707868481
4093,I'm someone who's happy enough to stand in front of others and put their kind of head on the block as the saying is make a decision and accept that if it does go terrible the consequences will come back and I can't just pass the blame on,0,0.43441758665660263
4094,Uh I think this is self-evident in positions I've held so far in my univeristy time in the UK where I was on the student council for my college Robinson College in Cambridge for both my freshmen and sophomore years,0,0.4316075683376617
4095,Um two different positions but both of them elected and competative elections,0,0.2387154408523499
4096,Obviously my peers think that I'm uh suitable leadership material,1,0.6100299707868481
4097,Um how does that allude to you from previous response sports is another big part of my life,0,0.20153115289626916
4098,And in that I've had um competency rules with school's rugby and then college rugby and also college ruin,0,0.04151446662050083
4099,Um so I feel I have the experience of leader of having been a leader before and I have the confidence to lead others while also realizing at the same time that there will be others in the group that have strengths that I don't have,1,0.6100299707868481
4100,So um I'm humble enough to realize that and and hopefully get the best out of others by not insisting that the way that I've initially thought to approach the problem is the only solution,0,0.1352367738043197
4101,You can be a leader a very good leader by listening to suggestions that others have and being able to discern which are implementable and which are merely to put on the let's leave that for now pile,0,0.2372142273492121
4102,So yeah I would feel that I'm a good leader,0,0.43832997198318147
4103,Yeah so the obvious examples here would be sporting achievements and stuff but I think and just out of a variety a good antitote for growth um in the UK we still have a monarchy one of the few countries that do,0,0.3731609464718653
4104,And the queen's husband rather than being king is the Duke of Edinburgh,0,0.08830690875445948
4105,I'm not sure why he doesn't get to be a king but anyway so there's a scheme called Duke of Edinburgh's Award which is aimed at 16 17 18 year olds,0,0.24372173559947308
4106,And there are three tiers too bronze silver and gold,0,0.13457995866975905
4107,So I've completed all of them,0,0.09444753853762607
4108,I have the set of the gold,1,0.5724056014340263
4109,And in order to do this a big part of it that people that undertake this scheme that they raise is the expedition element,0,0.07018898356424853
4110,Um you go somewhere you haven't been before with coordinates certainly maps compass tents troungier and enough food and supplies for like four days,0,0.45741044182905144
4111,Um you follow a predetermined route but obviously you have to uh like deal with unexpected realities,0,0.07772698000874113
4112,If there's flooding and suddenly a path is no longer a viable transport option you got to reroute yourself around that,0,0.34429759838933055
4113,If I come too exposed and there are high winds you need to decide for a different sleeping point for that night,0,0.3611869277514505
4114,We did our gold expedition in the summers in the final years of my high school,1,0.5852163666581659
4115,We traveled to which is a very nice area naturally,1,0.5052336361306978
4116,We spent three days four night hiking really glorious weather,0,0.2571389984462586
4117,One big mission,0,0.2387154408523499
4118,When we encountered another group they were lost,0,0.17070910373751436
4119,quite hysterical,0,0.14316569343261962
4120,They thought they will never be found,0,0.35466757698507523
4121,We made a decision we would make a detour from our way to get these other hikers in the nearest area so that they can then contact the other hikers they knew in that area,0,0.33141366362000685
4122,and pretty much get themselves back in to familiar surroundings calm them down make sure they are okay and go on to our planned destination,0,0.19732153176187164
4123,To be honest I did quite enjoyed that experience,1,0.5338463461786015
4124,getting to feel slightly like a hero,0,0.45321313756248316
4125,That was a time when we had to work as a team,1,0.5052336361306978
4126,One of us could not have dealt with all by themselves because they were five hysterical people with all their backpacks and equipments,0,0.17070910373751436
4127,They were tired,0,0.11521478613197428
4128,They weren’t feeling like carrying any more we had to distribute their load among ourselves and make sure we do not lose them on our way from where we found them to where we ultimately drop them off in the nearest village,0,0.2977831921157918
4129,The whole expedition is a big example of team work,0,0.39245568688584626
4130,keeping each other motivated keep going at the pace of the slowest individual so that no one is left behind,0,0.2115156921086478
4131,encouraging each other so that the slowest individual is not on the ground,0,0.2115156921086478
4132,It was massively enjoyable experience,0,0.39245568688584626
4133,That would have been one major team work experience,0,0.39245568688584626
4134,I think umm the one thing that really seems to set me aside between me and a lot of friends and my brothers that I could probably benefit from caring a little more about my outward appearance,1,0.5235537960611565
4135,Not that I think I dress very scruffly or anything but I don’t really mind leaving the house in the morning with my hair soaking shower and wearing jeans and t-shirt,0,0.058349808998298384
4136,two out of three of my brothers worry about straighten hair which I wouldn’t agree at all,0,0.2704138274778955
4137,but if I cared little more just making sure my hair is not messy when I leave the house that would probably be small benefit,0,0.10272802370478028
4138,given that even though there is a saying don’t judge by covers people inevitably make decisions as soon as they see you,0,0.14525437569119656
4139,and they can’t perhaps if I was a bit more self conscious about my appearance that would be something of a benefit,0,0.21611320583280333
4140,I think this is the kind of job in which job satisfaction can be the greatest benefit if it is something that is genuinely interesting to you,1,0.7538129355606162
4141,And as I said before I have such a deep rooted interest in space exploration just really pushing the limits of what we can achieve,0,0.02268282555041385
4142,I feel that this kind of job is what I will just get up in the mornings really thrilled get into work and do my parts towards contributing towards it,1,0.5235537960611565
4143,umm I realize it’s also the kind of job where projects are really so vast ranging there is gonna be inevitable variety and also this would scare me I would be really drawn I get to challenge myself in various different ways novel situations that I perhaps haven’t encountered before with the opportunity to work with other professionals who are equally umm well established within the field that you are really getting to work with the best and that can only help improve me as a professional and as a business person,0,0.1738164489300764
4144,and it’s um yeah other things such as inevitable prestige and umm the financial benefit just the job satisfaction,0,0.060661407047331486
4145,I can easily see this something that will interest keep me coming back for work for the length of my career,1,0.6490718829987913
4146,That would be the key reason,0,0.2387154408523499
4147,um I think I would just be able to enjoy the work and therefore put my best and get the best out of my and ultimately give the company the best chance to success,1,0.6100299707868481
4148,thanks for letting me come out,1,0.929060350894491
4149,umm It turned out okay,0,0.2387154408523499
4150,I think it was a group of case female,1,0.532476616497347
4151,17 to 18 years age range,0,0.2387154408523499
4152,we opened nearby village public and get to a public phone,0,0.33141366362000685
4153,our school was quite strict,0,0.20894356666517588
4154,didn’t allow us to bring mobile phone,0,0.33141366362000685
4155,which was probably a good thing,0,0.45321313756248316
4156,I'm a student here at MIT I'm in my third year as a junior um and I'm studying chemical biological engineering with a minor in economics,0,0.17772661287718336
4157,And so as part of that I've uh taken coursework in transport processes thermodynamics chemical biological processes and things like that,0,0.1768600974688769
4158,And also some macro micro public policy classes with the econ,0,0.07018898356424853
4159,And then I'm also doing research in chemical engineering laboratory here for a year and a half studying yeast um and different ways of doing transcription factors and how they relate then to promoter architecture and the dynamics that are behind that,0,0.1768600974688769
4160,So lot of bio chemical engineering complications,0,0.07018898356424853
4161,And I also did some research this past summer in a systems biology lab in Madrid Spain um so a little more biology related so those are most of my technical background,0,0.09444753853762607
4162,Yeah so um I definitely think I'm a leader and that's actually something that's come to define a lot of my time here at MIT is leadership,0,0.20470832345123025
4163,Um and so I think I'm a leader both because of the actions I've taken and also the mindset I have and as actions I guess both of those things are important,1,0.6100299707868481
4164,So to give an example um I'm currently in a position of leadership in a club on campus our Habitat for Humanity club um where I serve as the president of the club and I think I started off as a freshman um just participating I really like community service so I volunteered with them a bit to go help build houses in the Boston/Cambridge area um and then I was fairly proactive which led me to start organizing those builds that I was going on I figured I was benefiting from them so I wanted to be able to give back and organize them so I ran for the exec of Habitat for Humanity here and started helping organize them and then from there I went on to wanting to do more and so now I'm president and run the exec and get to do everything that the club does and so um I think that kind of drive and that desire to move up and give back and contribute and also make things happen definitely is characteristic of a leader,0,0.1679107013538831
4165,Um and obviously the position I'm currently in is one that demands leadership,0,0.3022838906250506
4166,So I think that's just one illustrative example of why I'm a leader,0,0.15455013832531528
4167,Yeah um so I definitely think I'm a team player um and I think MIT especially is really conducive to teamwork,0,0.058349808998298384
4168,Um but I'll look at a example of team work than relates actually to um I'm also involved in leadership within my fraternity,0,0.23226963873358347
4169,And so as a part of that um we have a five person exec that uh I wasn't on to begin with but uh I've now loosened up and wanted to take on more leadership help out and so I'm currently on,0,0.14153925129016182
4170,And so as a part of that five person exec um we've had to do a lot of teamwork,0,0.1066093052570166
4171,There's five of us there's uh my fraternity has seventy people,0,0.4064865837293959
4172,Um so it's very large and it requires a lot of working together in order to um accomplish really any task,0,0.17963402645220658
4173,And so I think um one illustrative example is we wanted to put on a philanthropy event that I was spearheading in my position,0,0.22419003988946132
4174,I was doing brotherhood development activities like a philanthropy even,1,0.5724056014340263
4175,And so we haven't really had much precedent we haven't had an event in a couple of years um and so I had come up with a summer with an event based off some stuff for other friends and other schools who I've talked to,0,0.05293056977477877
4176,Um and so I had the idea for the event and then I had to work with these other four members to kind of lead the rest of our brotherhood in putting on the event organizing it um and there was a lot challenges because it wasn't there was no precedent we hadn't done things like this in the past um so we had to work to like motivate people within ourselves to go out and get people to register and participate and things like that,1,0.5852163666581659
4177,Um and there's also of course the challenge of then finding others,0,0.2387154408523499
4178,Um give us five dollars to participate in our event why it's of any value why it matters,0,0.33141366362000685
4179,And so that duality was really a challenge as well as of course working amongst ourselves and so we met those by really laying out very concrete goals um and like doing a lot of brainstorming among the five of us breaking up um to focus on different elements of the problems we would face,0,0.033447486732009805
4180,Um and the event ended up being really tremendously successful and then we had a lot of people participate,0,0.2571389984462586
4181,We met those goals of participation and money raised um and then were able to have the event again this year and really set a precedent that hadn't existed before so it was very successful,0,0.2571389984462586
4182,Um so I think currently um what my greatest weakness and one which I'm working on is my ability I talked a lot just now about leadership positions and so they definitely impact me a lot,0,0.3937983692193587
4183,Right now my ability to successfully delegate um and the word I'm not necessarily looking for the word micro-manage but just truly delegate responsibility work with another person and let them be very responsible and communicate with them,0,0.4716025486650735
4184,I think i struggle there and that's definitely a weakness in my leadership as well as just my general activities because i struggle just to let that person kind of go and foster their own ideas and get their own job done,1,0.5737824960575687
4185,I'm very quick to step in and assist maybe step on their toes even or at least provide feedback,0,0.45468571979582034
4186,Sometimes it is warranted and sometimes I think it isn't and so to be more cognizant of that and to uh be better adept to deal with that I think would be very helpful,1,0.6100299707868481
4187,And so I'd love to see that change,0,0.1768600974688769
4188,It is something I'm working towards and I'm working with people whose leadership I admire um who I think do a better job of that then me and try and model myself after them but currently I do think it's a weakness that I'd like to improve,0,0.3937983692193587
4189,Okay,0,0.2387154408523499
4190,Yes,0,0.2387154408523499
4191,So for this particular job um I think my greatest assets are the combination of skills and experiences that I bring to the table,0,0.27356360199342006
4192,Um and I think that it'd be very valuable for the position,1,0.6100299707868481
4193,So I have a very strong technical background I'm in my third year at MIT studying chemical biological engineering which requires a wide array of very challenging coursework,0,0.08191717026182452
4194,Um and I've done research in the field as well so all of those skills combine to give me a strong technical set of both problem solving and engineering based skills,0,0.2704138274778955
4195,And then I also have done a lot of work outside of the classroom both in projects that are academic related and totally not community services related and things of that nature um truly develop communication skills organization skills um and the ability to really take a project and get it done,0,0.06788794010145202
4196,And so I think for this position I will have the technical background to fully understand and wrap my mind around and make goals that I want to accomplish just solve a problem and then these other skills will ensure that not only can I identify a problem but if I identify a problem I will get it done and I know how to facilitate whatever resources that are available to me to ensure that whatever job gets done well so I think that will make me a very strong candidate,0,0.1352367738043197
4197,Alright,0,0.2387154408523499
4198,um So for starters I am a senior taking an extra semester so you know half-way through junior year in that sense,0,0.3611869277514505
4199,I'm a chemical engineer I'm a rower light weight rower not a heavy weight,0,0.4730831849790573
4200,I have the extra an extra bonus of having to deal with a weight cap that sort of thing,1,0.5724056014340263
4201,Diving in the middle of the year can be fun sometimes,0,0.45321313756248316
4202,I'm in a fraternity um it actually recently started up,0,0.18051115217519223
4203,So I was a founding father of the fraternity it's Sigma Alpha Epselon,0,0.09444753853762607
4204,And I've also done very rougly coordinated engineering leadership program,0,0.09444753853762607
4205,So I'd say those are my main commitments,0,0.09444753853762607
4206,I had done other things earlier one I went to Baker and I was very involved in the executive committee there,0,0.4730831849790573
4207,And I'm also an active member in creating the dining plan that currently exists at MIT,0,0.09444753853762607
4208,It's got some pros and cons but it is a good experience so sort of like go door to door and talk to people and really see let them know what's coming up,0,0.08335277541638189
4209,THat sort of thing,0,0.2387154408523499
4210,In general I'd say I'm a pretty active person on campus pretty well known um and I do a lot of things to keep myself in shape but also academically stimulated with chemical engineering and whatnot,0,0.1768600974688769
4211,Very much so,0,0.2387154408523499
4212,um I guess to start out being part of the sport sort of creates a natural affinity towards teamwork,1,0.6100299707868481
4213,Especially with rowing you're depending on other people to be able to accomplish a common goal there's eight guys in a boat and then there's the person that steers it,0,0.45741044182905144
4214,And if one person gives up you guys aren't going to win,0,0.16870585012516354
4215,So that is very much like teamwork it also coincides with leadership,0,0.13457995866975905
4216,Rowig doesn't necessarily cultivate leadership it sort of cultivates like personal dedication and willingness to contribute to the whole,0,0.39245568688584626
4217,But I feel like I get my leadership experiences from my fraternity,0,0.27356360199342006
4218,Especially since it started out I was one of eight people there was five that was the founding five that was part of the first pledge class,0,0.3022838906250506
4219,And when things are starting up everyone needs to take a leadership role and if anyone like cuts any slack it's very likely that the whole ship is going to sink,0,0.07652237551739818
4220,So right from the get go I was given tons of responsibility and I went with it,0,0.1768600974688769
4221,I did as much as I could in each of the positions and eventually I came up to the role of you know the President,1,0.5395318149680698
4222,um And in that role I've gotten a lot of praise from the alumni groups and from my students but generally I feel like I'm a pretty good I like to work with people um I can relate to them and generally pretty sociable so yeah,0,0.43832997198318147
4223,Alright let me come up with a good example here,0,0.39245568688584626
4224,Alright Gordon has a new leadership program very much about being a team player,0,0.2387154408523499
4225,There's different opportunities that that program provides every single week it's divided up so that each student gets an opportunity to be a leader or be a part of the team,0,0.2387154408523499
4226,One of the modules for instance there was it was a negotiation module,0,0.2387154408523499
4227,So every single table was given a set of legos,0,0.07018898356424853
4228,And there was the goal of the project was to create satellites which requires a certain number of colored legos from each table and every table was given different combinations,0,0.07018898356424853
4229,So I was not the team leader in that case but the team leader's goal was to make sure that we had good negotiations going with all of the tables adjacent to us and coordinating everything,0,0.25353811833686407
4230,And at times it got a little bit frustrating because there were time limits and people were running all over the place,0,0.030395260313939607
4231,And one of my roles was to be one of the negotiators so as the team player my role was to simply talk to one table get as best of a result as possible to get the parts that we need to make the satellite but not to be directing people and nothing of the sort,0,0.30353397813348454
4232,um My natural instinct is to direct people so what I had to do instead to make sure that I was used effectively as a team leader you know just give the team leader suggestions that sort of things but also do my duty negotiate we consulted for a while,1,0.6480443715079547
4233,Said OK Cameron we need to get three white legos for four brown legos etc etc,0,0.33141366362000685
4234,So I managed to get my end of the deal done um also contribute to the team leader but also give him advice and that sort of thing,0,0.09444753853762607
4235,It's kind of a lower key example just because those modules the time schedule is an hour,0,0.2387154408523499
4236,But they put you in a high pressure situation but I felt like I did a good job there because I didn't go all up in arms and tell the team leader that he was not doing a good job that sort of thing,0,0.32951325534129816
4237,So I did my best to give him the suggestions to steer him in the right direction and ultimately it got us to the end goal,0,0.25353811833686407
4238,Yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
4239,I go back and forth with this,0,0.3938730607112474
4240,When I was younger in middle school uh I was a lot more modest I was just generally a quieter person,1,0.5338463461786015
4241,You know everyone goes through different phases through elementary middle high school college that sort of thing,0,0.13115931029929018
4242,um And ultimately I turned into someone taht was a lot more sociable outgoing that sort of thing,0,0.4716025486650735
4243,But at times I feel that I can come off as I hate saying this but I other people don't say it but sometimes I feel like I may say something and it might be cocky or something of the sort,0,0.1352367738043197
4244,So one thing I'm really trying to balance is to make sure that I have confidence but it's not overbearing,0,0.02935760559696661
4245,So I guess what I'd wanna do right now like if I could change something is really try and bring back the modesty because I really respect people that are modest but still able to get a lot of work done,0,0.11320191250810435
4246,um And I mean it's not something that I can't change it's just something that's really not jibing with my personality right now,0,0.23226963873358347
4247,So I'm really you know trying to tow the line,0,0.044103996970689556
4248,But if I could make that switch I'd at least like to see what kind of a person I'd like to be right now,0,0.1768600974688769
4249,I guess I guess I'll leave that answer for now,1,0.6114423030620092
4250,Yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
4251,Yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
4252,Well the job is it's a pretty lots of people look are sort of looking at it at MIT but it's consulting,0,0.13457995866975905
4253,You work with people you work with teams and every single team has a project with a defined deadline scope budget that sort of thing,0,0.2886839945882999
4254,Which is the stuff I've learned from the Gordon Leadership Engineering Program,0,0.3022838906250506
4255,Um so that you know exactly that working in a team trying to accomplish a goal in a certain time blah blah blah,0,0.25930501603055445
4256,I'm a very big fan of that ever since I joined the program I'm like wow this is business I like business,1,0.6490718829987913
4257,And the reason why I prefer consulting right now rather than going into energy or going into connectors? that sort of thing is just because of the breadth,0,0.21611320583280333
4258,I like I'm a person that likes to keep my doors open and consulting is one of those really good segways in my opinion from undergraduate into the industry,0,0.38535842737456816
4259,I'm not particularly interested in grad school at the moment just because there's no one thing that like I wanna like I don't wanna narrow my scope quite yet,1,0.7035513784479208
4260,So I feel like consulting will give me an environment where there's still a young vibe with a lot of newer people and also expose me to older people and really uh I'll be able to test my skills that I've cultivated while I've been here in the job industry,0,0.11320191250810435
4261,Yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
4262,Uhh so I'm uhh I was born in D,0,0.3022838906250506
4263,moved to Nigeria when I was seven umm came back to America for my junior and senior year of highschool and applied to MIT,0,0.3022838906250506
4264,I always wanted to be a mechanical engineer so it was sort of a straightforward choice for me,1,0.5724056014340263
4265,It was always my first choice school and umm I was excited to come here and to start learning things,0,0.4716025486650735
4266,It just in the past it had just been sort of hearing about things but not doing anything or learning about it which was exciting,0,0.39245568688584626
4267,So I'm studying mechanical engineering here now and umm I'm concentrating in computer science and electro engineering which has been a new found interest I guess,0,0.15455013832531528
4268,It's uhh I'm a junior now so yeah,0,0.09444753853762607
4269,I do think I'm a leader in some regards,1,0.6114423030620092
4270,I mean it's important to not always and sometimes you don't want to be a leader,1,0.6915140386658857
4271,Um it's important to know how to follow as well but I think umm I am like in most situations a leader,0,0.27356360199342006
4272,For example I was uh sort of like the leader for my 212 Intro to Robotics group where we build a robot amongst the four of us four to five,1,0.5852163666581659
4273,Uhh my group happened to be four,0,0.3022838906250506
4274,We built a robot,0,0.33141366362000685
4275,I sort of lead the group: organizing meetings uhh delegating tasks making sure that everyone was doing uhh what they were meant to and just getting everyone on the same page,1,0.5724056014340263
4276,So just instances like that I think have shaped me into being a leader,0,0.27356360199342006
4277,Uhh so yeah like I said it's also important to know how to you know let someone else take the lead,0,0.21899413203219753
4278,And so my other project class this semester I'm taking to double in (unintelligible) and it's a group of eight people so there's even more sort of heads to balance,0,0.04151446662050083
4279,And so uhh just sort of working with everyone making sure that you know everyone sort of has a say in what's going on,0,0.08967900877249617
4280,There's a particular instance where it's at the beginning of the project we're meant to design a yo-yo and we couldn't really decide on a design 'cause everyone wanted to do their own sort of thing,0,0.14385601394430575
4281,And umm my role in that particular situation was to getting everyone to recognize the manufacturing aspect and not only the design aspect,0,0.09444753853762607
4282,So we ended up choosing something that was easy to manufacture as well as had a good design,0,0.19732153176187164
4283,Change one thing about myself,0,0.3022838906250506
4284,Uhh I'd say like to,0,0.4716025486650735
4285,I wish I had a sort of better background of academics,1,0.6490718829987913
4286,Uhh I didn't go to like the best high school,0,0.4716025486650735
4287,I didn't uhh like have the best teachers or things like that,1,0.5724056014340263
4288,And coming to a place like this and sort of seeing a lot of people who are I mean obviously kind of naturally talented but who have also had good- they've had opportunities to uhh show their talent and get better and smarter,0,0.1768600974688769
4289,Umm I wish I could've had that opportunity,0,0.3022838906250506
4290,I think I'd be uhh even more- I could do more things than I am doing today,1,0.6114423030620092
4291,So yeah,0,0.07018898356424853
4292,Mmm-hmm,0,0.2387154408523499
4293,Because uhh you should hire me for a few reasons,0,0.34429759838933055
4294,One is because my leadership uhh abilities which I've talked a little bit about umm a little earlier,0,0.3022838906250506
4295,But also just my willingness to learn,0,0.1768600974688769
4296,Umm I think more than the average person I'm excited to learn new things umm and sort of put those things in practice,1,0.6100299707868481
4297,And just as an example I didn't know anything about computer science before coming to MIT,0,0.09444753853762607
4298,But just uhh taking just the introductory class learning about that I got really interested in that and so I'd say that when I don't know a lot of things or when my experience isn't the best I'm always willing to learn a lot,0,0.06788794010145202
4299,And lastly I'm a really hard worker,0,0.014469458775212067
4300,And so I'm able to put in the hours and the time and the energy that it takes to sort of get a task done,0,0.09444753853762607
4301,It's uhh yeah I think I'd make a good intern,1,0.7642480901805394
4302,Thank you,1,0.9723827022850665
4303,Ok,0,0.2387154408523499
4304,I'm a junior at MIT majoring in electrical engineering computer science as well as mathematics,1,0.5724056014340263
4305,Um and I have a couple of previous internships under my belt as you can see on my resume so I feel like I come prepared with a lot of experience both from school and outside,1,0.6712110669180035
4306,Uh yes I would say that I am a leader,0,0.3022838906250506
4307,Um in particular I've been involved in many student groups on campus such as educational studies program mystery hunt and several other groups that I have leaderships positions in,0,0.15248303418968046
4308,But even when I don't have a formal leadership role as I do in those groups I feel like I still tend to take charge in situations whether it's a group project for the class where you know we're supposed to be working collaboratively but I'll be sending emails to make sure we're moving forward and making progress,0,0.43722042557844615
4309,Or something a bit more structured actually supposed to have a have a leader like I mentioned student groups,0,0.11320191250810435
4310,Yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
4311,So yes heh I would call myself a team player and to go back to sort of one of the examples I was just talking about with uh the educational studies program with a fairly large student group,0,0.21611320583280333
4312,We have a couple hundred different MIT students teach with us but a core team of about 30 to 40 admins who come to meetings every week and help out,0,0.33141366362000685
4313,And unfortunately being college students there's a lot of personal conflict between members and I have had to step in several times with sort of individual people first notice that there's a problem um talk to the people in question individually to figure out more about what's going on and then intervene and sort of set aside rules and sort of help them interact well professionally and keep their problems outside the group,0,0.08191717026182452
4314,Um I don't really want to get into details because some of these can be personal but I have had to do this,0,0.12805425526188313
4315,It's a difficult question,0,0.11521478613197428
4316,I'd probably say my age,1,0.5353244206591785
4317,I feel like there are a lot of experiences I've missed out on sort of looking backing at you know high school say now that I'm in college or looking back at a first internship once I've done a second,1,0.6372689311704398
4318,Um there are a lot of ways I think I could've learned more or matured more as a person had I got into situations with a different mindset,0,0.4316075683376617
4319,So um I guess what I'm trying to say is if I knowing what I know now will able to go uh redo some of the things of the past year at least which isn't physically possible,0,0.15455013832531528
4320,Ok well as I mentioned before I have a lot of experience I leadership I'm a team player but uh beyond that I think I'm just very well qualified and passionate about your company and would be excited to join the team and work with you guys to further your goals,1,0.6712110669180035
4321,I'm Good,1,0.5724056014340263
4322,Uh so I am a biology major at the IT um Burton of Biology,0,0.3022838906250506
4323,I'm also getting a minor in chemistry,0,0.3938730607112474
4324,I'm currently pursuing research on marine micro-biology specifically Carlson bounds at the Thompson Lab,0,0.3938730607112474
4325,Um previously i had worked on arsenic metabolizing simbions in the sponge in Israel and I hope to continue working on marine-microbes,0,0.4716025486650735
4326,Umm I would say I was a leader not so much uhm in maybe project teams but definitely in terms of uhm my research view,0,0.3572911640991484
4327,I would like to be on the cutting edge of uhm new research and to uhm microbes encyclobes vents part of the ocean so i would say that i'm really looking forward to researching but really haven't been exposed so much,0,0.13113956182223993
4328,Uhh yeah I would def consider myself a team um player,0,0.4730831849790573
4329,Uh so when I am part of the team HPV group now at IT so we raise awareness about the Hepititus B virus,0,0.221435459245776
4330,so we rec had a lot of difficulties with quest uhm industries so they're the ones that provide us with phlebotomists and in order to conduct the screening hepatitis B screenings that we have,0,0.04721556736134647
4331,so Uhm there is a pretty large conflict about like how we should reach out to them to get them to get them to interact with us and whether or not we should uhm maybe reach out to other providers and i definitely tried to make sure that we were keeping up with our contacts at quest as well as like researching like new avenues - reaching out to giliad which is another industry uhm core that could uhm also that works actually with MIT in particular,0,0.057803487703000624
4332,Um so together we delegated work and so one person had to do this um reach out to them and one person had to do that and i was def a big part of taking in whatever everything that we had to do and like trying to make sure everyone had something in order to not let this really important part of our work would be lost,0,0.16569992293552951
4333,Uh i would def say it would be my self confidence issues,0,0.2704138274778955
4334,or rather my ability to speak up and be more uhm assertive about my point of view,0,0.118032441819917
4335,I've definitely a lot of times kept quiet or just like put my views on the back burner especially I think when i was a fresh coming to a new country it was very difficult to integrate and also like to navigate my way in so i think i'm still trying to cope with that,0,0.24476056556419554
4336,I def think i deserve to get into grad school because it's the only thing i want to do - research for me is extremely exciting and there is a lot,1,0.7642480901805394
4337,i feel like its the most meaningful way that i can contribute to uh the scientific world,1,0.7642480901805394
4338,and especially in my field,0,0.09444753853762607
4339,Uuh i def am dedicated to research it's what i want to do for the rest of my life so i hope that i get this opportunity,0,0.1768600974688769
4340,I'm good how are you?,1,0.6359670093958226
4341,So I'm studying mechanical engineering at MIT and I am taking the flexible course which lets me concentrate on a subject other than mechanical engineering,0,0.1768600974688769
4342,and I've chosen to concentrate on building technology,0,0.09444753853762607
4343,And on top of that um I'm double minoring in energy and architecture to supplement my concentration,0,0.1768600974688769
4344,And I'd say two years ago two summers ago sorry I interned at Square One Armoring Services which is a company that manufactures armored vehicles for the government,0,0.3150767045299086
4345,And I interned with them for two summers and this was before I really chose the building technology route,0,0.03414728906078335
4346,I didn't really like the super mechy side of it,0,0.31213544981287855
4347,This past summer I interned in Barcelona um with a company called Ilon(?) they're a very large engineering consulting firm and I worked in their architecture department,0,0.4716025486650735
4348,And I really enjoyed the experience,0,0.06788794010145202
4349,So I'm going that direction,0,0.09444753853762607
4350,I believe I am a leader,0,0.4730831849790573
4351,Um I normally I wouldn't necessarily run for positions but when it comes down to someone filling the spot I will step up um and make sure that things get done,0,0.3022838906250506
4352,I feel that I might be more of a,1,0.6114423030620092
4353,of an encourager so to speak,0,0.2387154408523499
4354,I don't really like sliding my ideas down the table and making everyone follow it but I try sort of to like to lead people in the direction that I want to go to and to integrate their input with mine,0,0.13113956182223993
4355,Um so I uh had a coach here this past year to plan the campus preview weekend dinner um at my sorority,0,0.3022838906250506
4356,Its a weekend where MIT pre-freshmen come on campus to see if they like the feeling from MIT and its a big recruiting event for a lot of different groups around campus,0,0.45321313756248316
4357,And um so my coach and I had very different ideas at times about what we wanted to do and how to go about doing it but I feel that communication was defiantly the most important factor in sort of getting through those difficulties and working together as a team and we wound up having a really successful event,0,0.07732075106804231
4358,Um a lot of the girls that came to the dinner um who are now freshmen still say Oh I remember you from (unintelligible),0,0.19015119047044987
4359,It was a really good feeling to get through that,0,0.17963402645220658
4360,Um I'd probably change trying to be a perfectionist,0,0.3572911640991484
4361,Um I like doing things right and sometimes its not the most time efficient or energy efficient way of getting about things,1,0.5338463461786015
4362,Um I think thats something to sort of a strange thing to work on to let things be sometimes heh,0,0.3937983692193587
4363,I think I'm qualified for this position academically and I've taken a lot of courses that apply to building technology,1,0.7642480901805394
4364,And my intern experience as well,0,0.1768600974688769
4365,I'm really interested in the subject matter and my parents are architects so I've sort of had this my whole life and I've always kind of denied my interest in architecture because everyone always pushed me towards it but now I do realize that this is something I truly enjoy,0,0.05898187383578916
4366,And sort of mixing it in with my other more technical interests um I feel bring me further in the field,0,0.27356360199342006
4367,Good how are you?,1,0.8452898993011722
4368,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
4369,OK so I'm a third year linguistics student umm I'm uhh working on some linguistics research right now and I'm interested in going into linguistics research after undergrad,0,0.3080838209192851
4370,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
4371,Yea I think I'm uhh leader,0,0.4316075683376617
4372,I think I've fulfilled leadership positions in the past and umm I think I've excelled in that role umm,1,0.7642480901805394
4373,I've led different group projects in my classes and I've also been umm a resident associate advisor in my dorm umm and I've led activities there where we had to organize events for freshmen once a month uhh to get them interested in different aspects of the curriculum and also umm just general helping them out for things so,0,0.4131020896771991
4374,OK umm so yea I think I work well as a team member umm for a big group project we had in one of my linguistics classes umm we had to look at aspects of a language and so we were broken into groups of four umm and we were each split to look into different aspect of the language so two people looked at the phonology or the sounds of the system and my partner and I looked at the grammar of the language and so one of the two people assigned to the phonology group wasn't really following through with his part of the work umm,0,0.419070542885303
4375,He I guess he was busy with other classes but his partner was really stressed out about it so she came and talked to my partner and I and asked what she should do about it cause he wasn't helping out,0,0.34651595146154224
4376,And so the three of us sort of talked about it and then we emailed him asked if he could come meet with all of us,0,0.1066093052570166
4377,The four of us were able to talk about it and work out an agreement where he did some of the,1,0.5052336361306978
4378,some extra work in putting the two parts together the phonology and the syntax to make up for the fact that he hadn't done as much for the original research,0,0.39245568688584626
4379,So that ended up working out well so,0,0.13457995866975905
4380,Um I think it would,0,0.4316075683376617
4381,probably be my shyness because that tends to hold me back,0,0.3572911640991484
4382,Um but I think I've been working to change that,0,0.4316075683376617
4383,Um I've been trying to practice things umm like presentations that make me nervous or that I have problems with because I'm shy,0,0.2704138274778955
4384,I've also been trying to get out and meet more people,0,0.3938730607112474
4385,I've been doing more extracurriculars,0,0.3938730607112474
4386,And umm I volunteered to teach a class to middle schoolers and high schoolers so that sort of helped in a low stress environment practising presenting,0,0.08191717026182452
4387,Um I think I would be a really good addition to a linguistics research team because I'm really really passionate about linguistics and it's something I really enjoy spending lots of time working on,0,0.34651595146154224
4388,Um and I enjoy working on a team and I work well with other people,0,0.4716025486650735
4389,And I've had research positions in the past and I think I would umm be a good addition to a team,0,0.27356360199342006
4390,I'm good how are you?,1,0.6359670093958226
4391,I'm a freshman at MIT here so I'm studying courses 6 and 18 which is computer science and math,0,0.17772661287718336
4392,Umm in high school I did a lot of community work service,0,0.4716025486650735
4393,I was the president of our United Way board which is a not for profit,1,0.5067186044464734
4394,I did a lot of our school clubs math teams classic goal,1,0.6790936156954253
4395,I was captain of a lot of those and then on campus here part of my sorority Sigma Kappa the tech,0,0.4730831849790573
4396,fair which is involved in bringing a lot of companies and students here to showcase their things,0,0.39245568688584626
4397,I think so,1,0.532476616497347
4398,I think umm I have a little different view of what a leader is,1,0.6114423030620092
4399,I think there's definitely one aspect that's very obvious that you know you bring everyone to do what you think is best but I think the most important part of being a leader is incorporate everyone else's ideas,1,0.8088170427287866
4400,I think a lot of times some people who are really strong are like natural leaders but they don't always take the time to make sure everyone else likes what they're doing and they're very straight forward and they go for it but I think what makes a really important leader is being able to incorporate everyone else's ideas and find that middle ground that everyone wants to do,0,0.20919740887807237
4401,Definitely umm I know in high school as a senior last year they gave us a lot of group projects to kind of bring us out of the stereotypical classroom and get ready for uh a new environment in college and I remember one of our projects it was my group and we were doing something for our econ,0,0.3694476305055536
4402,class and it was we had to like model a situation and do the graphs and econ's like very straight forward graph wise there isn't that much to deal with but my group had like different ideas of how they thought the lines would shift and I remember everyone was just kind of in a panic,0,0.19821442239249298
4403,We had to double graph four different scenarios and no one knew what they wanted to do and we just had to take them two at a time and I like looked at all of the graphs and there was some things that were similar just everyone had a different way of going about it so I like kind of tried to combine all the ideas and we ended up coming up with a graph that was almost a combination of everyone's so it worked out in the end,0,0.30353397813348454
4404,I think what I'd change about myself is that I I've always grown up a very private person,1,0.6114423030620092
4405,At home it was just I always felt like my problems and my issues weren't as important as what other people were dealing with so I tend to deal with them myself which as you grow older and the problems are just so silly like a little middle school problem may become a lot more weighty when you have so many of them and so because of that it's sometimes I get bogged down in myself,0,0.16949659631330274
4406,And I never let it affect my work because I don't want anyone else to be burdened by it but after a while it gets very overwhelming and so I wish that I'd just be more willing to share that with people,0,0.08191717026182452
4407,I think I should get this job because I think there's so many opportunities at this company that I'd really like to be a part of,1,0.5235537960611565
4408,There's just a lot of chance for growth and a lot of chance also to do something that you love and also make a difference because of it,0,0.45741044182905144
4409,I think that the way I deal with problems and working together but also trying to find the best solution and bring people to that level is something that could really benefit the company as well,0,0.3133450648821134
4410,Hi I'm good how are you?,1,0.9147915433602074
4411,Umm well I have been going to MIT for four years now going to graduate this year umm I do computer science and I really enjoy it,0,0.13113956182223993
4412,I really like to play music,0,0.31213544981287855
4413,I've been involved in several music groups ac- across campus,0,0.3938730607112474
4414,I play flute specifically,0,0.3938730607112474
4415,Umm and I grew up on a farm in South Dakota,0,0.3022838906250506
4416,It's a great place,0,0.39245568688584626
4417,Okay,0,0.2387154408523499
4418,I'd say that I'm a leader because often- First first of all in my friend group and and any group of people I generally take the lead and- For example where we are going to eat umm,1,0.7895481244380342
4419,And I work in a lab currently and I need to direct the project umm for writing a a website to collect music samples from people in Toronto,0,0.1768600974688769
4420,Umm and I'm primarily directing this project and I work with some grad students and I make the plans for how its going to work,0,0.4716025486650735
4421,Okay,0,0.2387154408523499
4422,Umm recently I was working umm just this last week actually in a group for my computational biology class,0,0.12805425526188313
4423,And we had some struggles dividing the work,0,0.0926304816353907
4424,It was it was kind of a difficult thing to especially since some of us were from a biological background and some of us were from a computational background,0,0.17070910373751436
4425,Umm we had a hard time deciding the project so that it was equal work for everyone,0,0.2977831921157918
4426,So it was kind of difficult to resolve that but what we ended up doing was changing our project,0,0.04721556736134647
4427,Umm so I tried to come up with some ways to make sure that everybody had enough umm enough work to do based on their backgrounds,0,0.4716025486650735
4428,Umm I think that I would like to make myself more comfortable umm meeting new people,1,0.6100299707868481
4429,I think that that would enrich my life,1,0.7642480901805394
4430,I think that I have great background and great experience specifically in the field that that this job would be for,1,0.7642480901805394
4431,And I really enjoy learning new things and I think that I'm be good at it,0,0.11320191250810435
4432,And so in web programming specifically there's always new technologies coming up and so I'd be really excited learning how to use those,0,0.06788794010145202
4433,I'm doing well thanks,1,0.9824285457861849
4434,And yourself?,0,0.08967900877249617
4435,Well I'm Zaynab,0,0.4716025486650735
4436,I am a junior in chemical-- majored in chemical engineering at MIT but I'm doing a minor in energy studies and a fo-- a concentration in anthropology,0,0.17772661287718336
4437,I think that I am a leader,1,0.6114423030620092
4438,This is because I've held various leadership positions at college thus far and I think with my leadership the groups and the organizations that I've been part of have been able to succeed,1,0.6100299707868481
4439,For instance at the moment I'm the vice president of the African Students Association and the MIT African Students Association as well a group of 80 students both international and domestic students,0,0.2704138274778955
4440,So we're more of a social group where we throw social events such as like cultural shows and study breaks and things like that just to get the African students ignited and just united so that they can confront each with whatever problems they have,0,0.0926304816353907
4441,So I guess the most recent event that we had was a cultural show where we displayed to the entire MIT community just about what it's like to be African like through-- we did it through performances such as like dancing singing spoken word and things like that,0,0.3731609464718653
4442,And also other schools from the Boston/Cambridge area like Harvard Boston University Wellesley and so on they also came attendance and that was fun,0,0.13457995866975905
4443,I think the time like when there was a conflict in my team was when I was doing this project for one of my classes which was in my sophomore year,1,0.5737824960575687
4444,So there was like a group of four of us and we all divided the topic evenly so that we could all focus on a specific part of the project,0,0.19732153176187164
4445,However there was one person that just wasn't pulling her weight,0,0.2387154408523499
4446,So I wasn't too sure whether it was just she's stressed or busy with other things like towards the end of the semester where she just didn't put the effort into doing what she was meant to do,0,0.1768600974688769
4447,So I did confront her about it and she told me that she hadn't had time to do the necessary work,0,0.08191717026182452
4448,So I just said just block out some time in your schedule and let's meet up and let's do the work together and we were able to produce um I guess a very good product at the end of the day,0,0.43722042557844615
4449,The option to change one thing? I think I would be more outgoing in the terms of speaking being able to speak to others more freely and confidently because at the moment I do speak with people I don't know and do work with people that aren't my friends or aren't in my social circle but I wish I was more outgoing in the sense of I was more comfortable speaking with other people and interacting with other people things like that,0,0.43832997198318147
4450,I think I should get the job because I have a very strong academic background,1,0.7642480901805394
4451,I have experiences in different companies thus far in my very short academic career and I think I've been able to work with a variety of people,1,0.7642480901805394
4452,I would be an asset to any team I'm a part of,0,0.4730831849790573
4453,I'm doing well how are you?,1,0.6359670093958226
4454,So my background is in mechanical engineering um what's um,0,0.09444753853762607
4455,and product management so product development,0,0.07018898356424853
4456,Uh basically what I'm looking to do now is uh find a role that combines product management and uh communications skills to be with a technical background as well,0,0.4716025486650735
4457,Yes um so I think leadership doesn't have to be something that always uh done in a formal role,0,0.4316075683376617
4458,I think leadership is something that you do actively in every part of your life uh whether it's taking initiative turning on a light in a dark classroom when no body wants to stand up something small like that to actually having a formal leadership role with uh leading a group and team members,0,0.301200705418423
4459,So I try to always uh stay on top of those things,0,0.1768600974688769
4460,So take initiative if I'm in a group scheduling a meeting whether I have a formal role um and be on top of things and uh be proactive,0,0.1768600974688769
4461,Definitely,0,0.2387154408523499
4462,Uh so right now I'm working on a I just actually finished a group project that we were doing,0,0.4977678613554029
4463,And we had to design this uh speech system,0,0.1066093052570166
4464,And we got to a point within our system where we surveyed a large number of people it was like 630 people that we surveyed and we realized that what they wanted was not what we'd designed our system for,0,0.19732153176187164
4465,One thing about myself,0,0.3022838906250506
4466,That's a tough one,0,0.39245568688584626
4467,I have a tendency sometimes to take on a lot all at once and not,0,0.45468571979582034
4468,I will sometimes get bogged down in all the little details of prioritizing all the small fun things that I have to do and not always taking a step back and focusing on um the small picture,1,0.7035513784479208
4469,But I'm trying to change that in the way I focus on manage my time um really noticing what is it that I'm dedicating my time to and how can it be better utilized,0,0.06788794010145202
4470,Or what is it that is actually should be a priority,0,0.014445118697821484
4471,Um and how do I reorganize things,0,0.3022838906250506
4472,So I try to do that um at least weekly just look back you know what did I do this week what did I get done where was I loosing time what was happening,0,0.11980571834570754
4473,Um to try to make try to uh fix that tendency in myself and um hope that becomes habit,0,0.3022838906250506
4474,I think I have a lot of qualifications that um fit exactly what this job is asking for,1,0.6114423030620092
4475,Uh both the skills to communicate and to manage people and technical background so I understand what's going on,0,0.3022838906250506
4476,Uh but beyond that I really I love the company,0,0.23226963873358347
4477,I love what's happening at the company I'm inspired by the work here,1,0.6490718829987913
4478,And for me it's really important that I not only enjoy the work I'm doing but also the people I'm doing it with,0,0.06788794010145202
4479,And so far everyone that I've met I've loved them,0,0.1768600974688769
4480,And it's been a really great experience,0,0.05007391579932511
4481,I'm doing well how are you?,1,0.6359670093958226
4482,I'm uh a junior in computer science,0,0.3938730607112474
4483,I used to be a chemistry major so last summer I worked in a chemistry lab synthesizing pharmaceuticals,1,0.6490718829987913
4484,But now I'm taking more computer science classes and I'm interested in software,0,0.09444753853762607
4485,Yeah I would say that I'm a leader,0,0.3022838906250506
4486,I have a lot of leadership positions,0,0.3938730607112474
4487,Again the president of my a Capella group and I'm the room assignment chair in my dorm,0,0.3022838906250506
4488,So I have to manage people like for the room assignment chair there's an event where I have to make sure that all of the freshman come down to the dining hall at a certain time and then get them to be lead around to the different parts of the dorm,0,0.21611320583280333
4489,And then they get to decide where they live,0,0.07018898356424853
4490,Yeah so eh I would consider myself a team player,0,0.3022838906250506
4491,In my a Capella group often times there are different disagreements about how we want to sing a certain song like whether a certain part should be loud or quiet and we have to discuss it instead of just arguing over the details,0,0.4291592311319982
4492,So we've gotten better at figuring out how to settle disputes,0,0.19732153176187164
4493,Mmmmmm,0,0.2387154408523499
4494,That's a difficult question,0,0.11521478613197428
4495,I would probably try to make myself less self conscious,1,0.5353244206591785
4496,Because it's uh it sometimes being self conscious gets in the way because it makes me think twice about doing something and then I hesitate too much and don't do something that I should do,0,0.4316075683376617
4497,Because I'm enthusiastic and I'm good at problem solving and I like Facebook a lot {laughs},0,0.2704138274778955
4498,Um Good,0,0.39245568688584626
4499,Related to self or career or…,0,0.2387154408523499
4500,Ok um so my name Jessica Aria and I come from uh India,0,0.09444753853762607
4501,I come from IT thinking and I do computers,1,0.5353244206591785
4502,I then did chemical engineering in Europe and Indonesia which I found amazing,1,0.6490718829987913
4503,So I was like maybe this is what I want to do,0,0.21611320583280333
4504,So I shifted over to computer science um and I’m a junior right now,0,0.1768600974688769
4505,It’s been going great,0,0.39245568688584626
4506,I’m generally interested in um in energy education recently robotics um,0,0.45468571979582034
4507,And uh What I um I hope to do I’m not particulary clear about what I want to do after that,0,0.1768600974688769
4508,Hopefully eventually something enterprenurial,0,0.2387154408523499
4509,And definitely including something I experience with before that,0,0.09444753853762607
4510,Depending on how that goes I may not stick with academics after that,0,0.3572911640991484
4511,Um I’ve always been super excited about that and doing projects that actually make a difference to you know people,0,0.28306467931876694
4512,That’s kind of what I want to do,0,0.3022838906250506
4513,But how I want to do it um is not yet been foregone,0,0.04448763548856515
4514,Um I do um,0,0.3022838906250506
4515,Well there is all that said sorts definitions of leadership,0,0.39245568688584626
4516,I do believe um that I have had the good fortune of being a leader um in numerous student clubs and in high school and even at MIT,1,0.6490718829987913
4517,Um even in the presence of graduate students,0,0.2387154408523499
4518,Um I’ve managed to sort of um,0,0.3022838906250506
4519,Obivously they know more academically but um I’ve still managed to like hold my ground,0,0.1768600974688769
4520,Oh and because I think I’m involved in a lot of stuff that goes on on campus stuff that’s just and um that’s what sort of made me realize that um I do like people,1,0.6100299707868481
4521,I like working with people and I like generally working on a team,1,0.7035513784479208
4522,I do believe I’m good enough to sort of lead and at the same time technical enough to sort of understand what it is that we want to achieve,1,0.7451478071734184
4523,And convince everyone and have this mutual consensus that this is how we should do it,0,0.13278584963937465
4524,Um so yeah definitely I feel like I like working with teams I like people,1,0.6100299707868481
4525,I work with um and example related to a class I took,1,0.6490718829987913
4526,I don’t remember the name of it exactly but it was something related to mobile development,0,0.3938730607112474
4527,We had to make an app as part of the class and one of our ideas was that if you have the I-phones and you could kind of bump the two of them together,0,0.2706965820470264
4528,It was kind of a novel idea in relation to what everyone else was doing in terms of photo sharing and meeeting friends,0,0.2387154408523499
4529,I was required with the technical expertise,0,0.3938730607112474
4530,There was this new thing that was developed at MIT’s regional lab called SWIPE which I had basically allowed you to swipe from one phone to another for data sharing,0,0.19015119047044987
4531,It was to get data across,0,0.2387154408523499
4532,It wasn’t really what we wanted but we thought it was a good start,0,0.37760135231850744
4533,A couple of members on my team knew the people that started it and one girl on my team was particular gung ho about it um the four the us,0,0.4064865837293959
4534,One guy was experienced and super excited to be trying new stuff,0,0.39245568688584626
4535,Another experienced programmer was relatively alright with this and then there was me who was sort of relatively alright,0,0.2869118389241647
4536,Um and there was someone else who was a freshman at the time and she was basically ok with every idea that we said,0,0.33141366362000685
4537,So we would not use SWIPE but thought of something that thought pushes and you know,0,0.10180891066238756
4538,I so well I would actually change even though this is in the past,0,0.13113956182223993
4539,I would have a deeper understanding understanding of math,0,0.3938730607112474
4540,That sounds really strange I know,0,0.057481900992564096
4541,But what I consider myself intuitive in general I understand the concept,0,0.08751967526954177
4542,I would want to know what to do in that situation,0,0.3938730607112474
4543,But in other situations I realize this is a really into academics,0,0.03414728906078335
4544,I realize that having a superior understanding of mathematics is so key,1,0.5724056014340263
4545,Um I really believe I have a good understanding,0,0.23226963873358347
4546,I just really wish I had done more of that um you know when I was littler,0,0.28427183694764935
4547,I wish I had just like known what I wanted to do when I was really little so I could have actually started working on it,0,0.13113956182223993
4548,But that being said that’s not something that’s not something that’s something I’m already working towards shifting,0,0.09444753853762607
4549,I’ve already gotten a lot better at you know understanding you know the theory behind the math,1,0.6359670093958226
4550,Um and definitely by the time you know I graduate um ready for this to will have changed,1,0.5380555749984539
4551,You know some people have been doing it since they were you know five and I kind of been doing it,0,0.21395836163353454
4552,This is not what I understand right now but last year I sort of could,0,0.4716025486650735
4553,I’m in my last semester as in three classes away from completing my computer science degree,0,0.4730831849790573
4554,So that makes me feel like I can do that,0,0.27356360199342006
4555,I wish I had done it a lot earlier,0,0.4730831849790573
4556,Um well it’s because first it’s about first it’s because I’m super excited about working in this industry and definitely in this company working with great people,0,0.4716025486650735
4557,Um I think there is a lot to be learned from that,0,0.4316075683376617
4558,And those two factors really is basically uh why I want it,0,0.03414728906078335
4559,And as to why I should get it and it’s because I can learn really quickly and um,0,0.04339595913205528
4560,I believe that I’m a team player and um and try to really fix things,0,0.23333067621579343
4561,And I would like to quote one of my professors who said either you’re building the product or selling it or getting in the way,0,0.21899413203219753
4562,So I definitely feel that um I could be um building the product really well um and to contribute in general,0,0.11320191250810435
4563,Positively with your message,0,0.45741044182905144
4564,So I am a Junior at M,0,0.09444753853762607
4565,T Ah I am in computer science and I have taken several classes in Algorithms and in [xx]Nessus six,0,0.3022838906250506
4566,and I am also doing studying on my own machine and I plan on taking that next semester before summer starts umm to develop data analysis and machine running skills,0,0.09444753853762607
4567,Especially in field of pattern recognition which I am very interest in,0,0.3022838906250506
4568,And uh I hope that will give me some training for internship that I will do in that field,0,0.09444753853762607
4569,ah That will give me more practice in the real world,0,0.2387154408523499
4570,I think I am,1,0.6114423030620092
4571,I think I am a leader,1,0.6114423030620092
4572,Ah I have lead several projects in the past ah As in my position as that community service chair and um and one in my ah fraternity pledge class and the other in my ah in the student group that I am part of,0,0.4716025486650735
4573,The South Asian American Student Corp and successfully completed,0,0.39245568688584626
4574,um Service projects with the community as well as organizing ah events for ah raising money for charity,0,0.39245568688584626
4575,ah and also for school projects,0,0.2387154408523499
4576,I frequently ah I am good at assigning tasks keeping people on task and um as well as gathering input from everybody um which I think are the essential quality of a good leader,1,0.7642480901805394
4577,I do consider myself a team player,0,0.4730831849790573
4578,Ah Going back to the example of my pledge class from my fraternity,0,0.3022838906250506
4579,uh we had several tasks,0,0.33141366362000685
4580,One of which would be to visit every other every student in the pledge class,0,0.2387154408523499
4581,Storm week this was during freshman year,0,0.2387154408523499
4582,and with a pledge class has 13 people it is not a impossible task but there were logistical problem,0,0.030395260313939607
4583,One communication trying to get everybody to participate another is figuring out the best way to go about things,0,0.39245568688584626
4584,People wanting to meet in the middle ect,0,0.2387154408523499
4585,So I did my part as a team member to lead people to my room and show up myself,0,0.1768600974688769
4586,um But a good team player should also make sure that other people are doing their job,0,0.45321313756248316
4587,ah Not necessarily in a lead or a managerial role,0,0.39245568688584626
4588,But with the same general properties as a leader ah that all the team members should be checking one another and so I ah pardon that to um when there was several members missing I would ah say hey you call this person and I will call this person,0,0.26459270552821346
4589,Split up tasks etc,0,0.11521478613197428
4590,Ah and also help in planning with what's the best route to go by etc,0,0.39245568688584626
4591,If I had to change one thing about myself?,0,0.3022838906250506
4592,Naturally there are a lot of thing I wish i could change about myself,0,0.3022838906250506
4593,I wish I could do better at basketball,1,0.6490718829987913
4594,But ah I think if I had to pick one quality it would probably be my ah abillity to stay focused on a task Although I am pretty efficient at ah getting things done and I do create ideas sometimes I get distracted or I like to multitask so I might be staying on task with work in general but I'll like to have three different homework sessions going on at once and find this one and this,0,0.27356360199342006
4595,A lot of times that will work really well for me but if I working collaboratively that may not work best for other people,0,0.2796426796551633
4596,So making myself more adaptive to other peoples study styles working styles etc that would probably help me a lot,0,0.21611320583280333
4597,I think I should get this job because ah for two main reasons,1,0.6114423030620092
4598,One because I would provide a lot the company because I am very efficient at working,0,0.4716025486650735
4599,I can think creatively for new ideas,1,0.532476616497347
4600,Say for new ways to analyse certain new data or to optimize the running of the ah of certain ah software,0,0.2387154408523499
4601,ah On the other hand,0,0.2387154408523499
4602,The other reason I should get this job,0,0.3572911640991484
4603,Is because I would be a valuable member of valuable member of the workplace in this field I think by getting more experience um with this start up I think I would ah Really would help me with my study skills that would help me in the future,0,0.34651595146154224
4604,Mm-hmm,0,0.2387154408523499
4605,Fine thank you,1,0.9723827022850665
4606,How about yourself?,0,0.15445987288440202
4607,So I'm from Berkley California,0,0.09444753853762607
4608,And I came to MIT to study bioengineering,0,0.09444753853762607
4609,And it's been a really great education because I've learned to combine like engineering skills real world skills with all this academic knowledge um and especially true in my lab where the combination between hands-on research and like thinking about how the research is working has really come together to improve my understanding of science and medicine,0,0.08546649212793798
4610,I think I have great leadership potential,1,0.7642480901805394
4611,Uh I am currently head of the Greek MedLinks at MIT,0,0.3022838906250506
4612,And what MedLinks is is this really great program where we serve as the liaison between students and healthcare facilities,0,0.035864535156242786
4613,MIT has so much support so much support,0,0.39245568688584626
4614,And there is,0,0.07018898356424853
4615,I mean we have,1,0.5067186044464734
4616,the students have great access to it,0,0.39245568688584626
4617,But a lot of times we don't know to look for it,0,0.1066093052570166
4618,Right? It can be right in front of your face and if you're not looking it's not there,0,0.45741044182905144
4619,So we do a lot of outreach stuff,0,0.1066093052570166
4620,So,0,0.07018898356424853
4621,Sure,0,0.2387154408523499
4622,So I think team work is,0,0.27356360199342006
4623,the only way to get anything done,0,0.2387154408523499
4624,right an individual what are you going to do? Um so I played on the golf team in high school,1,0.5380555749984539
4625,And we're a close-knit team,0,0.1066093052570166
4626,But golf is a mental game and sometimes it can get to your head if you're not playing well and you just play worse,0,0.0975864765320015
4627,And it's a downward spiral,0,0.07018898356424853
4628,And you're with someone out on the course for five hours,0,0.08967900877249617
4629,And if you have like a little feud between each other you're still going to be stuck with that person for five hours,0,0.07772698000874113
4630,So I'm not great with administrative work,0,0.1768600974688769
4631,I have trouble with like little menial deadlines and all this writing and signatures and getting everything organized,0,0.35729155202333646
4632,It stresses me out,0,0.11521478613197428
4633,But I'm learning to deal with it by electronics,0,0.09444753853762607
4634,ah! The new age! It is my savior,0,0.4716025486650735
4635,Well I think I should go to medical school because I love people and I love to help and I've got the academic background for it,1,0.6100299707868481
4636,I'm not afraid to work hard and put in long hours,0,0.35729155202333646
4637,Medicine is fascinating surrounded by all these diseases that,0,0.39245568688584626
4638,I mean we've made such great progress but there's just more that we can study,1,0.6790936156954253
4639,So I'm currently studying in my lab uh work in an HIV lab,0,0.1768600974688769
4640,And that really inspired me to go into medicine because you know I'm looking at all these cutting-edge technologies and it's like I want to be right where they're being implemented not just on the research side but on the people side as well,0,0.08679865998235442
4641,Um I am a sophomore at MIT,0,0.3022838906250506
4642,Um I'm studying brain and cognitive science with a minor in biology,0,0.3022838906250506
4643,Right now I’m working in a lab that is more of a narrow cognition lab,0,0.4716025486650735
4644,We work um basically to try to figure out pathways in the brain that process different functions,1,0.5052336361306978
4645,Um it’s a longitudinal study,0,0.2387154408523499
4646,Um so it’s something I’m really interested in,0,0.12805425526188313
4647,But I think moving forward I’m going to try to start working with from a pharmacology aspect because it’s such an emerging field,0,0.15455013832531528
4648,Um that’s mainly where I want to go because I hope to eventually work um in [??] and so pharmacology would be very important for that field,0,0.21611320583280333
4649,I think I am a leader in a sense that I see people as people and I see tasks as tasks and I know how to communicate effectively between how to get these tasks done and how to get the people to do them,1,0.7642480901805394
4650,And I think I’m a good motivator good communicator and I’m also very detail-oriented,0,0.27356360199342006
4651,So it helps me better able to break down um people in order to delegate um more fundamentals or specific tasks in order to get them done more effectively,0,0.060661407047331486
4652,Yes I consider myself a team player because I do think I’m very fair and always open to what other people are thinking,1,0.6100299707868481
4653,So in [??] movement which is an on-campus student group which basically seeks to provide inner city Boston high school students with better access to reading and math comprehension to help better prepare them for the SAT test,0,0.13457995866975905
4654,We meet with three or four of them once a week on a Sunday,0,0.33141366362000685
4655,And large groups so they’re like small groups that two members are on a charter,0,0.13457995866975905
4656,So I’m part of a two-person team and then we all meet together,0,0.14153925129016182
4657,So I would sometimes disagree with my partner as well as the [??] as a whole in terms of what we should be teaching and what we should be focusing on whether we should look more at science whether we should have more holistic education versus just teaching to the SAT,0,0.15324969341575864
4658,I think that basically what I was trying to do was explain my point,1,0.6114423030620092
4659,If the group thought that what I was saying had some merit and liked to incorporate it I would feel good,1,0.6100299707868481
4660,But if they didn’t then I would accept the fact that that was the way they felt; and you know majority rules and I didn’t have any hard feelings,0,0.0901395103829997
4661,At the end of the day I wanted what’s best for the kids,0,0.4716025486650735
4662,So in a sense I am a team player because I want what’s best for the project as a whole,0,0.1768600974688769
4663,It’s not just all about me and getting my point across,0,0.3022838906250506
4664,I definitely think it would be making myself more organized,1,0.6114423030620092
4665,So I’m extremely detail-oriented and I see exactly what needs to be done and the timeline it needs to get done,0,0.09444753853762607
4666,But I guess since I’m involved in so many things being a student as well as in a sorority as well as pursuing various academic endeavors I think that um sometimes that bogs me down,0,0.27356360199342006
4667,Knowing exactly what I need to get done and what timeline and then I get overstretched,0,0.09444753853762607
4668,But I think that’s an easy problem to fix,0,0.1352367738043197
4669,Um and so far as we you know you get more specialized over the course of our lives,0,0.3927973489599513
4670,I definitely have a path that is more specialized that I intend to pursue,0,0.4730831849790573
4671,So that won’t be a problem and I think just maintaining basic organizational structure definitely helps me but it would be a lot easier if I didn’t have to maintain anything and that was just naturally the way I was so,0,0.1352367738043197
4672,I think that I have… I’m very interested in what your company is doing and I’m very interested in what this project specifically is related to but I also think I have a lot to offer the group as well,1,0.8088170427287866
4673,I am a MIT student who’s given a very specific set of problems and some solving skills that would be very unique to the group,0,0.21250816544335416
4674,But I’m also very outgoing and very interested in interpersonal relationships and I think that could help me convey our message as well as work with the technical aspect of the team,0,0.3731609464718653
4675,Um pretty good pretty good,0,0.39245568688584626
4676,Getting busy with studying for finals,0,0.2387154408523499
4677,Um alright so I I've been studying at MIT for three years,0,0.09444753853762607
4678,I initially started as a physics major actually so sophomore year I took um a couple physics classes in relativity um waves and vibrations,0,0.23333067621579343
4679,Uh and then one of the classes that had been recommended to me was computational neuroscience which also counts for physics department,0,0.39245568688584626
4680,So um after that was intro to neuroscience,0,0.07018898356424853
4681,So I took that fell in love with neuroscience and cognitive neuroscience so,0,0.08191717026182452
4682,I started taking more classes in that,0,0.3938730607112474
4683,Um I'm working on it um definitely,0,0.3022838906250506
4684,Uh I mean I do I do like working in a team as equal group members um I feel like I can be a leader,1,0.6100299707868481
4685,Uh for example this past summer I was in China and uh they let me uh teach a classroom of 60 students,0,0.3022838906250506
4686,Um and so that really help to strengthen my leadership skills just in terms of classroom management and getting everyone to work together as a group,0,0.23226963873358347
4687,Yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
4688,Um I feel like I I um so uh in that last summer as well in China we had sort of a problem,1,0.5066404005866445
4689,Uh we were trying to get some videos up on a website,0,0.33141366362000685
4690,um none of us had any computer science background and so um I tried to find a student who had both computer science background and spoke English to a level where we could like actually communicate,0,0.3235285561025297
4691,Um so uh I participated in that in that kind of way,0,0.3022838906250506
4692,Hmm,0,0.2387154408523499
4693,let's see,0,0.2387154408523499
4694,Um I'd say probably I get kind of nervous sometimes,0,0.18755857915192653
4695,Um I'd say I'd like to calm down a little bit,0,0.4716025486650735
4696,Uh I mean sometimes it's good like I,1,0.7035513784479208
4697,I have lots of energy but sometimes it's just a bit too much,0,0.45468571979582034
4698,[laughs],0,0.2387154408523499
4699,To be able to [??],0,0.2387154408523499
4700,Um so I mean I'm very committed but on top of that I have a very strong academic background,0,0.4716025486650735
4701,I've done research before in this area,0,0.3938730607112474
4702,And um in a similar field but sort of um also different,0,0.07018898356424853
4703,So I think I come in with a different sort of perspective to this,0,0.15455013832531528
4704,And also I mean I come in with like some physics background,0,0.1768600974688769
4705,So I think that additionally provides a different perspective on brain and cognitive science that isn't always seen,0,0.15455013832531528
4706,That sort of like very analytical way of thinking and like seeing things at the most fundamental level I bring that perspective in,1,0.5338463461786015
4707,Good thank you how are you?,1,0.9980475998712282
4708,Alright well so I'm originally from Australia,0,0.4716025486650735
4709,And um since then my family and I have moved around a lot so I would consider myself an international citizen,0,0.118032441819917
4710,I'm actually not an American citizen,0,0.18051115217519223
4711,Um but I've been here studying at MIT material science for uh three years now and I'm enjoying it,0,0.4716025486650735
4712,Um it's helped me figure out that I'm really interested in engineering and I'm really loving having a bit of material science as well as mechanical engineering which is what I'm doing a minor it,0,0.23226963873358347
4713,Yes definitely,0,0.2387154408523499
4714,Um well I can tell you that I was told that at a leadership conference that I went to earlier this year,1,0.5380555749984539
4715,Um we classified personalities in team-working situations and I was definitely one of the more leader type one people where I work well with a team but I like have things I like to do things well my way or I like to at least be,0,0.25353811833686407
4716,if I want to see something done right then want to I would like to do it right,0,0.4716025486650735
4717,Um then I've had a lot of chance to practice that and I would say that I've gotten pretty good at incorporating that personality type with other types of personalities in teamwork situations,0,0.4716025486650735
4718,So for example I'm um co-president I've recently been elected president of Amnesty International here on campus and I so I've had a lot of experience with that group up until now working with them trying to lead a team trying to help them take initiative for themselves trying to encourage them as well as be a leader by example and do all of as much as I can uh handle comfortably to make the club a success,0,0.1768600974688769
4719,Okay um well,0,0.39245568688584626
4720,Yeah um Amnesty International is another good example,0,0.39245568688584626
4721,We've had a few tensions between personalities,0,0.33141366362000685
4722,Um the year before so last year we had two co-presidents and one of them was a pretty opinionated person someone who had strong feelings toward his vision for the club and just went for it with all like all of his effort into that one direction and just didn't really look back and didn't look around to see how other people felt about it,0,0.201241396039797
4723,Which I was okay with because I saw his direction being really beneficial for the club um but we had another member of the team who was not okay with that,0,0.3235285561025297
4724,She felt also that she had a lot to give and she felt like none of her ideas were being heard,1,0.5309974197500003
4725,So they would actually get into some tense email situations and there was a bit of tension in the group,0,0.010514505885992124
4726,But it actually kind of became resolved during elections this year,0,0.024949938481925327
4727,Um they worked together fairly well during the semester um especially when they weren't both in the same room at the same time just working via email it was good,0,0.45321313756248316
4728,And then today uh sorry this week during elections it kind of all came out into the open and now that he's not president any more and she's in the same role as treasurer um it's been resolved,0,0.24978110917005816
4729,Um I guess my role in that was just kind of being uh the team player,0,0.4316075683376617
4730,Just trying to make whatever we trying to do work successfully so that there was no added tension from our efforts being a failure,0,0.2977831921157918
4731,Oh interesting question,0,0.39245568688584626
4732,I I would like to be a better public speaker actually,0,0.38535842737456816
4733,I would really like to be able to synthesize my thoughts quickly and coherently,0,0.38535842737456816
4734,Um I think that would make me a better writer and I think that in general being a great at communicating is one of the strongest skills that you can have to convince people to to just make whatever project you're working on be a success,1,0.6712110669180035
4735,To convince investors to invest money to obtain partnerships and sponsorships to be a good leader to inspire,0,0.39245568688584626
4736,I think I would love to be able to just have an infinite vocabulary and have a very you know better way of presenting my ideas,1,0.8088170427287866
4737,Um I do think I am qualified for the job because I've had a lot of experience in this industry,1,0.6100299707868481
4738,I've worked in research in material science for the last two summers as well as I've had a lot of leadership experience um not just in Amnesty International but also in my sorority,1,0.6490718829987913
4739,And um what was the other one I was an orientation leader for um orientation at MIT which was a cool experience,0,0.1768600974688769
4740,So um I've had a lot different ways to develop my team-working skills and I'd really like to put those to work in industry-based projects now um which I've seen a lot of but I've never had a chance to actually try it out,0,0.06788794010145202
4741,So I'm excited to try that,0,0.1768600974688769
4742,Okay well I'm a junior here at MIT,0,0.4716025486650735
4743,Umm I'm double-majoring courses ?? which is uh the ?? computer science and bioengineering and I guess those are two very different things so I get alot of questions about why and I think it's um because I came to MIT thinking I wanted to do bioengineering,0,0.15455013832531528
4744,And then I guess I just feel like I everyone around here like has some relation to programming sometime and then I took a programming class got bit by the bug and then I just like I loved it,0,0.1352367738043197
4745,And then so last year I decided to double major cause um I'm actually interested in a lot of I guess there is an overlap between like biocircuits as well as just modeling biological systems with computer science so um it was a really good opportunity here so yeah,0,0.11320191250810435
4746,Um I do think I'm a leader and then I guess that's one of the things me coming to MIT I wouldn't have said I'm a leader necessarily even though like I guess I was like did some things in high school,1,0.6100299707868481
4747,But um I think that's one of the things I' really thankful from MIT it's really developed my ability to be confident as well as um I think just to motivate other people and uh and it's like just like if I wanted to get something done like I think something really,0,0.11320191250810435
4748,like I think something really cool will happen with some ideea then what I'll do is I'll like get a couple of people together like get them motivated by uh figuring out what needs to get done logistically and just like assign people I think a timeline and stuff like that? And I think um my experience at MIT has uh like really given me that experience and as well as actually just allowing me to find these people that cause there's a lot of really awesome people here and usually willing to do the exact same thing,0,0.11320191250810435
4749,or you tell them about other ideas and they're really excited about it just like you are,0,0.06436505595457541
4750,So,0,0.07018898356424853
4751,So yeah so I think um what like one of the things I guess obviously is you have to be able to take direction just as well as you give it otherwise you're team can't function,0,0.32951325534129816
4752,And so I guess um one of the times I was on a team was um for example ah in a fraternity and for the fall we have rush which is basically all,0,0.10714651126468565
4753,we have 26 fraternities at MIT there's a 1 000 incoming freshman,0,0.33141366362000685
4754,You're essentially like all somehow competing almost for them but ah I guess one of the other things you're just looking for the people that are a good fit for you but you want to meet as many people as possible,0,0.19132873033898648
4755,So I think one of the things that is you have to be able to take direction from your from our rush chair,0,0.27384841386725367
4756,So it's sometimes he needs you just to go out on campus and try to get random freshman to the house,0,0.11222070821856067
4757,Sometimes you just need to go talk to people at the house and then like just have a converstaion with them and learn more about them,1,0.5196231351181234
4758,Sometimes you just need to clean dishes from the food event cause we need to get the next event so I think um just being able to,0,0.43722042557844615
4759,willing to take direction just doing anything and not losing track of the bigger goal is I think what makes me a good team player,0,0.3937983692193587
4760,Lot of nice restaurants,0,0.39245568688584626
4761,'laugh',0,0.2387154408523499
4762,Ah that's uh a really interesting question,0,0.17963402645220658
4763,Um,0,0.2387154408523499
4764,I think I would make myself ah maybe a little bit better I think just in um social sitatuions with strangers,1,0.7642480901805394
4765,Um sometimes I just can get a little bit like anxious,0,0.32230062042973917
4766,Uh,0,0.2387154408523499
4767,For example I hate like bit networking events because like I never really know how to like walk up to someone like just maybe like have small talk and then just leave the conversation,0,0.1388294277505842
4768,That's some of the things that like I guess I've never really been too extroverted of a person so I don't really like say necessarily good at just meeting lots of new people getting them like making a memorable impression or something like that? So I think um that's one of the the things I've been trying to work on,0,0.11320191250810435
4769,I think that's what's really nice about MIT is there's a lot of people like that,0,0.4429978114195979
4770,There's a lot a research,0,0.2387154408523499
4771,there's a lot of like lot of ahh session for people like there's a bunch of opportunities for networking for people who hate networking and then I think a lot of people have the same or similar just like philosphy about it,0,0.3937983692193587
4772,Um so I think just need to change to be better about that and just be better at talking to strangers and less apprehensive about approaching people and just starting up a conversation,0,0.3937983692193587
4773,Ok so I guess um right now I'm looking for some software internships for the summer and I think why I should have that job is just because I think I've gotten the technical background from like algorithms classes like software engineering classes? But then I've also had um the experiences of working as a team at MIT like uh I'm on student government um with my fraternity as well as uh I guess I'm pretty independent,0,0.27356360199342006
4774,I think MIT really develops everybody you choose your own classes like your own activities? And I think I'm very self-sufficient so I thnk uh for like maybe like super,0,0.25663342630896147
4775,I've like mabye supervised peers in previous internships and I think I would just be able to like take a project,0,0.43832997198318147
4776,I'm not afraid to ask a question if I need direction and I mostly like I can just work alone so I think it's be very helpful for I guess just like a supervisor cause then they don't have to check up on me all the time and uh but then uh the would also know that I would go to them when needed,0,0.24476056556419554
4777,Uh also I'm very thourough so I would like I don't like leaving things like if there's a small mistake I'll like even if it takes a long time I'll make sure that I can iron it out so I think for code-wise that's really nice for testing in that it's often more bug-free,0,0.05034229212330959
4778,So,0,0.07018898356424853
4779,Thank you,1,0.9723827022850665
4780,In my technical background um,0,0.3022838906250506
4781,Been a junior at MIT,0,0.2387154408523499
4782,Um I studied a lot of music but I've been mainly studying robotics mechanical engineering and a little bit of electrical uh at MIT here,0,0.3572911640991484
4783,So uh I've done a few robot competitions built a few and um you know that's basically what I do build robots and play music,0,0.11980571834570754
4784,I think I am a leader,1,0.6114423030620092
4785,Um because um I'm very calm,0,0.4716025486650735
4786,And I don't over react and I'm very good at I wouldn't handling is the wrong word,0,0.08191717026182452
4787,But I guess you know dealing with people and making sure that they can relate with other people,0,0.19261288316730724
4788,Making a team work,0,0.39245568688584626
4789,That type of stuff,0,0.2387154408523499
4790,Um I like to think I'm pretty sociable,1,0.5338463461786015
4791,Um I'm a nice guy and I'm easy to talk to and I think those are all very nice traits for a leader,0,0.27356360199342006
4792,So I would say yes I'm a good leader and based on previous leadership experience I say that I did a pretty good job so,0,0.1768600974688769
4793,Um I I'd definitely say I'm a good team player,0,0.4716025486650735
4794,Now are you asking about how I worked well with the team or how well I worked bringing the team together or how well I worked okay well uh I'll address all of them,1,0.5380555749984539
4795,Um I guess as a team member I very quickly learned what my role was and asked you know if there's anything I can do what do I need to do? And I do that fill that role,0,0.19261288316730724
4796,Um but I'm also very good at you know kind of combining all of the roles together,1,0.5380555749984539
4797,So say let's just you know on a robot for example there's mechanical there's electrical there's there's code work that also needs to be put together,0,0.16870585012516354
4798,And everyone can do a great job by themselves,0,0.13457995866975905
4799,But if they're not working together then you know like if I don't know what the guy the code guy is working on and what energy equations he needs and that type of stuff then I as an electronic guy or as a mechanical guy like it's not gonna work,0,0.21899413203219753
4800,Um and that's how I guess I work well within a team is kind of bringing people together,1,0.6100299707868481
4801,Um but if there are any like challenges I guess I faced as a team um I guess that really wasn't the question though was it,0,0.34651595146154224
4802,Could you repeat the question again I'm sorry,1,0.9226167300704804
4803,Okay um okay so a recent project I worked on with friends,0,0.4716025486650735
4804,Um there were these two guys,0,0.2387154408523499
4805,Love them to death they're great guys very talented Tyler and Dan,0,0.2115156921086478
4806,They're very close,0,0.2387154408523499
4807,They've been very close for I guess freshmen year,0,0.4316075683376617
4808,Um they have one of those relationships where good you know good high points but there's also like they fight a lot,0,0.45741044182905144
4809,So um there were a couple moments where they were just pissed at each other,0,0.07018898356424853
4810,They hated each other,0,0.11521478613197428
4811,They couldn't work well together so what I did was I kind of you know told them take take a step back,1,0.5380555749984539
4812,Tyler we're gonna go to the student center,0,0.33141366362000685
4813,We're gonna grab some food chillax and then we're gonna get back,0,0.33141366362000685
4814,And while we were walking to the student center I talked to him about it and talked to what his issues were,0,0.06408131848943939
4815,And then on the way back he was much more calm and things progressed a lot smoother and much faster,0,0.13457995866975905
4816,I would say,0,0.3938730607112474
4817,One thing okay,0,0.2387154408523499
4818,Um I would say time management,0,0.3022838906250506
4819,Definitely time management,0,0.2387154408523499
4820,Um it's been rough my whole life,0,0.15248303418968046
4821,Um I'd say it's definitely been getting better but I've definitely had problems with I'm very much living in the now and so sometimes I forget to think ahead,0,0.10272802370478028
4822,and um there have been many instances where I've got into trouble,0,0.04151446662050083
4823,I have a lot of work to do and it's you know coming up in like a few days,1,0.6359670093958226
4824,And sometimes I I should work harder earlier on but I don't get you know I don't get I'm like well I could work on it but I've done enough tonight,0,0.26459270552821346
4825,Why don't I I can figure it out tomorrow,0,0.1620597888134149
4826,And usually end up working really hard um right at the end,0,0.02732120278657856
4827,Which I guess a lot of people end up doing but if that was one thing I could change I'd say definitely better time management being able to spread it out more evenly and be more prepared,1,0.6100299707868481
4828,Okay,0,0.2387154408523499
4829,Yeah,0,0.2387154408523499
4830,Okay,0,0.2387154408523499
4831,Um should I go with just go with let my imagination flow?,0,0.3572911640991484
4832,All right,0,0.39245568688584626
4833,Okay so we're at a robotics interview,0,0.33141366362000685
4834,Um well I think I deserve this job a lot because I've been working very hard,0,0.3937983692193587
4835,I know a ton of control background,0,0.3938730607112474
4836,I know a ton about robotics mechanical engineering,0,0.3938730607112474
4837,Um I've had a ton of um hands-on work with robots,0,0.4716025486650735
4838,Um and I know all the work that goes into it,0,0.4716025486650735
4839,Um so as far as background and experience that I've had with robotics I'd say I'm very well um informed I wouldn't say informed,0,0.4716025486650735
4840,I experienced I don't want to use the word experienced again but that's I have a lot of experience in robotics,0,0.4730831849790573
4841,Um and I've since I've been working with it for such a long time I can learn more about it quicker and I'm very I'm very fast to learn,1,0.6490718829987913
4842,So throw me in a new situation,0,0.07018898356424853
4843,I'll you know Oh okay I know what that is,0,0.45888521649601605
4844,I can relate to that and I just work from there,1,0.6490718829987913
4845,Um and I think I'm a very I work well with people so robotics is one of those things where you have to work with a bunch of a group of people for a common goal,1,0.6712110669180035
4846,And I'd like to think that I'm very good at working with people so,0,0.21611320583280333
4847,Um and it it sounds like a fun place to work,0,0.39245568688584626
4848,I I've talked to you know some friends and some other people working there,1,0.5395318149680698
4849,And it's just I'd really love to work there,0,0.06788794010145202
4850,And I think I'm a good fit,0,0.27356360199342006
4851,Mhmm uh so is it all right if I kind of talk about the same stuff as last time?,0,0.4716025486650735
4852,I was going to say I haven’t changed too much but um yeah so still a junior at MIT here and um about halfway through junior year and um I’m a physics major and um I’m from Pensacola Florida and um I’m yeah so born and raised in Pensacola and I just um uh you know moved up here a couple years ago and started at MIT and I uh I’m not sure as far as what I’m going to go into career wise but I’m looking at something applied in the physics area,0,0.36752171347256557
4853,And um as far as extracurricular go I do a few things,0,0.09444753853762607
4854,I’m involved with a few IM sports that my fraternity does uh soccer and basketball and I enjoy juggling and unicycling as well,1,0.6490718829987913
4855,I’ve done I’ve unicylced since 5th grade and I’ve done that a lot and um I’m involved with the juggling club here and I like to play ultimate Frisbee as well from time to time just for fun and um yeah so you know enjoy doing sports in my spare time but uh yeah physics as far as school goes,0,0.36752171347256557
4856,Do I think I’m sorry?,1,0.7700714383290845
4857,A leader,0,0.2387154408523499
4858,Oh um yeah in some senses I like as far as leadership experience I’ve had I’ve enjoyed more in the small group type things,0,0.4716025486650735
4859,Like I’ve mentioned before in high school I led a small group of students to do a community service project where we organized a math competition,1,0.5852163666581659
4860,And um I uh I enjoy doing um for one of my internships I worked at a robotics firm and it was a pretty small group it was 4 or 5 of us but I go to kind of have some leadership on some of the tasks there that was fun,0,0.25353811833686407
4861,And uh yeah I mean juggling club is a little bit of a leadership position there’s a few people I kind of oversee there,0,0.09444753853762607
4862,And you know those few leadership experiences I’ve had have been really good um you know I guess besides those three I haven’t had any larger scale leadership experiences with you know more people but those I have enjoyed,0,0.14280139447180404
4863,I guess I consider myself a leader in that regard,1,0.7642480901805394
4864,Yeah um so I mean this past semester I’ve done some team stuff just one on one with a partner for my um lab class,0,0.3022838906250506
4865,And um so I got to kind of do some team playing there,0,0.09444753853762607
4866,But um I guess another time was uh last January I was in Mexico as well but this time it was with an exchange program and it was the whole month and next week I’ll actually going back for fun for a week,0,0.11320191250810435
4867,But yeah it was [???] Mexico and it was me and two other students at a high school and we basically got there and we thought they were going to know what we’re supposed to do it was the first time they had done the program and we get there and they were like “Okay well what are you guys going to do,0,0.35991343842711376
4868,” And we were like “Well we were going to ask you the same thing,1,0.5713018750224388
4869,” So we kind of had to come together with the three of us and figure out what to do,0,0.33141366362000685
4870,So we uh we talked at first and well kind of had familiarity with a lot of different subjects as far as like especially applications of what these students were learning calculus and physics and how to demonstrate those,0,0.19732153176187164
4871,We decided to each give little lectures on topics that were relevant to what the students were learning they might you know be going to a certain field to apply later on like especially calculus but also the physics classes and stuff,1,0.6309907918770912
4872,I ended up doing two main things I gave a few physics demonstrations uh and you know they had some equipment there I just talked about vectors and how to halve those and force equations,1,0.5395318149680698
4873,And then you know we had a couple weights and walked through the class how to predict how it would work out and actually measured it and so that was cool,0,0.09808217960583292
4874,All three of the students collaborated on what we should talk about because we kind of were familiar with what everybody else was talking about,0,0.3887681302185169
4875,It turned out pretty well we ended up helping them out and getting their students to have some faith and how these things of learning are applied,1,0.5052336361306978
4876,Yeah so I guess major time where a big obstacle is overcome,0,0.2397396965153384
4877,Um let’s see well the first thing that popped in my mind was that uh if I was a little shorter I could be an astronaut,0,0.4716025486650735
4878,But I think the height requirement is changed for that,0,0.15455013832531528
4879,I’m 6’3” and I think a few years ago it was 6’1” which is the cut off,1,0.6114423030620092
4880,Okay yeah that too,0,0.2387154408523499
4881,Um I guess um let’s see my um uh I guess as far as larger scale positions go like kind of being decisive,1,0.6100299707868481
4882,I think this is like a common problem for you know undergraduates here,1,0.5597729748834847
4883,Because you know you come in and I guess a major way American schools are different from schools in other countries,0,0.497733547164182
4884,We have all the options open and so um you know it’s a tough thing to you know have all these options and be decisive with one thing,0,0.2428917736095061
4885,And be able to like you know if you’re in an environment where you’re more restricted and you just put yourself in that,0,0.07772698000874113
4886,As far as larger scales go and smaller scales too with whether it’s I don’t know just managing things just day to day,0,0.3022838906250506
4887,I feel like time management’s you know a major part of that being decisive stuff,1,0.5304151609500547
4888,Yeah I think decision making would be the main thing,0,0.4316075683376617
4889,Yep,0,0.2387154408523499
4890,Um well I’m standing by one of the things I mentioned before,0,0.4716025486650735
4891,Which is mainly that I think I communicate pretty well,1,0.6100299707868481
4892,As far as small groups I’ve had a good amount of experience Working with people on you know in real time problem solving,0,0.3260083851308101
4893,I’ve had experience there and I think that’s a major attribute that I can bring to the board and bring to the table and um as far as experience goes yeah I mean things I mentioned before just coming back as far as like Diversity of background and being able to bring multiple perspectives,0,0.43832997198318147
4894,I have kind of experience with physics and more like applied things like robotics,1,0.5724056014340263
4895,So I think that diversity of things really helps and um yeah,0,0.058349808998298384
4896,Yeah thank you,1,0.9723827022850665
